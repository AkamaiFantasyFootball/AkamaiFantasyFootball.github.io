					<h2>Sleepers 2021</h2>

				<div class="blog_content_wrap">
					<p>The term "sleeper" refers to overlooked and undervalued players within the public's opinion. Last season, I reserved this word for undrafted players who have an opportunity to become weekly starters at some of this season. Last season I mentioned Justin Jefferson and Jonnu Smith, who were fantasy-relevant, and Preston Williams and Boston Scott, who weren't as successful. This season, instead of guys like Russell Gage and Mike Williams, who are drafted within the last rounds that I like, I went for guys with who I have more confidence can make a significant impact despite the higher ADP.</p>
					<h5>Courtland Sutton (WR) - DEN (11)</h5> 
					<p>During his breakout year in 2019, he finished with over 1,100 yards & six TDs on 124 targets from Drew Locke and Joe Flacco.  In half of the games in 2019, he finished with at least 5 receptions and 80 yards or a TD, making him the clear first receiving option on the roster. In 2020, the team added Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler, while Tim Patrick has also shown flashes with Sutton injured. The added competition in targets will help keep defenses from focusing on him every play despite losing the target share he once had.</p>

					<p>While I don't expect him to surpass his 2019 numbers, his ADP outside of the top 30 WRs seems like an overcorrection. Don't forget that Teddy Bridgewater is the new starting quarterback and will likely provide some consistency to the offense giving Sutton a floor. At his ADP of a WR3, he's definitely someone who can crack the top 24 WR if things fall his way.</p>

					<h5>Kirk Cousins (QB) - MIN (7)</h5>
					<p>This sleeper is mainly for Superflex/2QB leagues, where consistency becomes more valuable than upside in your second QB. Throwing over 4,000 yards and 30 TDs in two out of three seasons, he is a sneaky value, especially in six-point passing TD scoring leagues. He lacks the upside of a weekly starter with the run-heavy offensive philosophy; however, that opens up opportunities for big plays (higher yards per attempt (8.3) than Patrick Mahomes (8.2) and Aaron Rodgers (8.1)) with Jefferson, Thielen, and Cook. As a result, I'm confident that he will likely outperform his ADP of QB18-22 and provide a handful of top 12 performances from my 12th round pick. </p>
					
					<h5>Tyler Boyd (WR) - CIN (10)</h5>
					<p>Since 2018, he's been a top 24 WR in PPR scoring formats except for last season, with over 1,000 receiving yards in 2018 and 2019. In 2020, before Burrow's injury, he averaged nearly seven receptions and 70 yards on eight targets finishing with double-digit scoring in seven out of ten games. Drafted a round or two after Tee Higgins and rookie Jamarr Chase; he has fallen into the 9th-10th rounds as a WR3/4. This discrepancy has me targeting him in any PPR leagues, even in standard formats as a high-floor WR4.</p>
					<p>I'll admit the lack of TD/volume upside isn't great, and Jamarr Chase may end up taking a more significant than expected target share within the offense. However, that's priced in his ADP, while the potential of 80 receptions and 1,000 yards from your WR4 is very tempting.  </p>


					<h5>Tyler Higbee (TE) - LAR (11)</h5>
					<p>After his strong 2019 season, where he finished within the top 10 TEs, he disappointed fantasy managers last season, where he finished outside of the top 12. However, with Stafford as the new QB, there's a good chance that Higbee will outperform his ADP as TE10-12 and even have a top-eight TE season with Gerald Everett and Josh Reynolds leaving in free agency. He has drafted a WR over the past two years to compete for targets, but it would be silly not to expect Higbee's production to be closer to 2019 than last season. With guys facing increased competition for targets going ahead of Higbee like Logan Thomas, Dallas Goedert, and Evan Engram  (Curtis Samuel in WAS, Devonta Smith and Zach Ertz in PHI, and Kenny Golladay in NYG), I'm okay with letting them go ahead.</p>
