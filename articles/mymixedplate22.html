					<h2>My Mixed Plate - 2022</h2>

					<p>If you’re not from Hawaii or have never visited, the terms “mixed plate” or “plate lunch” means a meal made up of entrees and sides.  Mixed Plates are usually larger than your average plate lunch but are considered plate lunches too.</p>
					<p>As a yearly tradition, I'm making a list of guys I'm targeting in every draft regardless of scoring formats within a standard roster format (QB/RB/RB/WR/WR/TE/WRT Flex). Using tiers to categorize players' groups, I will explain my general roster construction strategy for 2022 and compare them to typical entrees and sides on my <b>mixed plate</b> </p>

					<h5>White Rice - Wide Receivers</h5>
					<p>While it is boring alone, it plays a vital role because it needs to go with everything else on the plate and is one of the more significant portions of the meal. Eating overcooked/undercooked rice almost ruins the entire plate lunch despite being one of the most straightforward items to prepare correctly. Because of that, you don't want to take a chance on somewhere that messes up the rice since it's practically expected not to deal with it in decent restaurants. </p>
					<p>Wide Receivers are compared to rice within the metaphorical plate lunch because many quality options are available. You can't expect to compete for a championship without a decent WR core. There's a general narrative that a good strategy is to draft RBs within the first two rounds and then add WRs within the mid-rounds (3-7) shortly after. Many of them are projected to finish closely among each other, providing a surplus mentality among fantasy owners, and tier-based drafting becomes more valuable. While the depth among receivers is extensive, I believe a few players are valuable and will provide that perfectly cooked rice that will complement any roster. </p>

					<h5>Entree: Chicken Karaage/Teri Beef/Ahi Katsu - Running Backs</h5>

					<p>An essential part of the plate lunch, the entree(s), is the show's big star. Usually, it's some form of meat or a medley of vegetables that provides the main attraction. Many places make similar dishes with their own twist on the recipe or combine two different meals to create a unique fusion. As the star of the dish, they make or break the entire meal. Some places are locally known for specific dishes that can't be found anywhere else. </p>
					<p>The narrative of drafting RBs early will apply again this year. Unless you're in a PPR league, it would be difficult for me to draft a WR within the first round besides Cooper Kupp and Justin Jefferson. Because of the depth at other positions, the scarcity of finding an RB without multiple question marks drives the value up. After that, you question what attributes you value the most. From the projected role within the offense to the potential upside/downside risk and the off-season narrative, all play a role throughout the off-season. It's essential to have a loose idea of what kind of players you are targeting to keep track of specific guys you are higher/lower on. I want a player with opportunity, shown the ability they can produce, and slightly undervalued. </p>

					<h5>Macaroni Salad/Side Salad (Tight End)</h5>

					<p>Macaroni Salad or “mac salad” is a secondary but necessary side dish to the plate lunch. Many places prepare it the same way, while some add some vegetables to make it unique. For the most part, I like the majority of mac salads that I come across, although I do not hesitate to substitute for more rice or tossed greens if I don’t enjoy a certain one. </p>
					<p>Tight ends fit this category because I don't feel bullish outside of a couple of guys outside the top five. The remaining six to seven guys have cases to finish within the top ten. Certain restaurants will have the perfect side dish, whether they offer your favorite dressing or add the right amount of vegetables to add some crunch. We all have our preferences, but in other places, we don't have a strong opinion either way, and I think that tight ends after the top five seem to be within my view. As a picky eater, I tend to stick to what I'm comfortable with when it's not a particular type of food I enjoy or have tried before. I believe the same applies to tight ends.  </p>

										<h5>Drink (Quarterback)</h5>
					<p>If you've been following me, you may know that I don't prioritize having a specific drink with my meal. If you haven't, I would be eating my food at home where I had my certain drinks or if at a restaurant, have water to save money. With that said, having a drink is still important. For some, they need to have their favorite soda/juice. Others are fine with any soda or tea. It all depends on the manager and their preferences. Of course, if you can get a soda for less than a dollar, compared to the $2.75  they usually charge, I'd choose that, and my parents would oblige as well. </p>
					<p>Quarterbacks are comparable to drinks because it's easier for me to decide what I don't want rather than what I like best. Of course, I have my soda/juice preferences, but I will not dehydrate myself because my favorite choices aren't available. Sometimes, all we need is some clean water, and fortunately is available for me in the waiver wire or later rounds. </p>
