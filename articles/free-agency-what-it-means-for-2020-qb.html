					<p>Unless you're in a dynasty league, fantasy football currently doesn't occupy your mind during May. Let alone during a worldwide pandemic that is spreading across the world, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and economic turmoil. I hope this will provide some insight and entertainment on a whirlwind of free agency and NFL draft with all that's been happening. Like stars in a constellation, I will connect various statistics with who teams drafted to create narratives on how they help their teams and what we can expect this upcoming season.</p>
					<p>QUARTERBACK: While their value is fantasy doesn't correlate directly to wins and losses on the field, a change in quarterback affects the offense from target distribution between receivers to the total volume of passing attempts throughout the season. What makes quarterbacks unique in fantasy, is the effect that they have on their teammates. So while the quarterback may be nothing more than a streamer in 2 QB leagues, he could boost the value of the players around him. We have seen examples such as Ryan Tannehill and Andy Dalton, improve or save their teammates' fantasy outlook, such as A.J. Brown, Derrick Henry, and Tyler Boyd. </p>
					<p>Please note that this only includes fantasy relevant quarterbacks who signed a new deal or restructured an old one. Sorry to Brian Hoyer and Kyle Allen.</p>
					<h5>Ryan Tannehill - TEN = 4 years, $118 million, $62 fully guaranteed.</h5>
					<p>A.J Brown owners rejoice! This signing will be added fuel to the hype fire that propels him to a Top 15 wide receiver for the 2020 season. Derrick Henry owners are also happy since he blossomed when Tannehill was under center rushing for 1,124 yards and 12 touchdowns in nine games. With offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, we can expect the Titans to resume establishing the run to open up the passing game for Tannehill and A.J Brown. When it comes to projecting Tannehill as a top 10 quarterback, it gets slightly tricky because he has the upside and some risk.</p>
					<p>When it comes to the quarterback position in fantasy, it's all about where you drafted him. Double-digit rounds? Sure, I'd pick him every time. But if he's in the top 6-8 rounds like Russell Wilson and Josh Allen, I'd prefer those names instead. RT Jack Conklin, who started every game for the Titans since drafted in 2016, signed a long term contract with the Browns this off-season. With their first-round pick, the team drafted tackle Isaiah Wilson to help fill the void. Not sure if he will make an immediate impact, but it's better than doing nothing. On a run-heavy team (2nd lowest total passing attempts in 2019), it would require him to repeat his 2.2 passing touchdowns per game average. Projecting that over a 16 game season, that would equal 35 touchdowns, and he's never had more than 27 in his career. If you think he'll get at least 30, he could be the perfect candidate for a late-round quarterback to get you just enough points to win.</p>

					<h5>Philip Rivers - IND - 1 year, $25 million, fully guaranteed.</h5>
					<p>Here's our first fresh start for an established veteran. Philip Rivers has been fantasy relevant for over a decade, averaging more than 4,000 yards and nearly 30 touchdowns each year. He's shown the ability to support a star receiver, which bodes well for TY Hilton and likes to target the running back and tight ends. Could this lead to an increase in market share for Nyheim Hines? Behind an excellent offensive line and a commitment to the run game, it wouldn't be impossible to improve his efficiency while limiting his mistakes. The team drafted wide receiver Michael Pittman and running back Jonathan Taylor with their first two picks in the second round. TY and Jonathan Taylor will be weekly starters, perhaps Pittman will have some upside along with Parris Campbell. With the 16th highest-scoring offense last year, could they jump to the top 12 with the young additions? It may not happen at first, but don't be surprised if the team gets hot later in the year.</p>
					<p>One thing to note is that the Colts were in the bottom ten for total passing attempts last year while the Chargers are tied for the top ten. With this drop in volume, we cannot expect him to replicate the same production even with improved efficiency. Sure, Jacoby Brissett is not the same player as Rivers, but neither has been Rivers recently. This past season with the Chargers, he finished with the lowest passing touchdown output since 2007 and was the third time in his career with 20 or more interceptions. He also finished fourth in total passing yards, which means he was moving the chains, couldn't score. He didn't look like the same player, and it's fair to assume he isn't at 38 years old. I can see a weekly streamer where he will have reliable performances, but not enough upside for me to draft him.</p>

					<h5>Tom Brady - TB - 2 years, $50 million, fully guaranteed w/ incentives. </h5>
					<p>In my life, there was never a time where I imagined Tom Brady playing in anything but a Patriots uniform. Now he's throwing to Chris Godwin and Mike Evans in a vertical offense. With Brady at age 43, the offensive line will need to protect him to allow the deep and intermediate routes to develop when the season starts. They let starting right tackle Demar Dotson test free agency and signed former Colts tackle Joe Haeg. They also drafted tackle Tristan Wirfs in the first round and a couple of running backs to add depth. I'm optimistic that Evans and Godwin will be top 15 options, and Brady can be a weekly start. It will depend on the offensive line (11th most in sacks allowed, 6th in QB hits in 2019) on whether it improved enough to protect a top eight quarterback.</p>
					<p>We know the team was 4th in most total passing attempts last year and tied for 14th in total rush attempts. This is attributed to the game script due to the 30 interceptions from Jameis Winston that put the fourth-highest scored against defense in difficult starting positions. Can we expect the numbers of turnovers to drop noticeably? (Brady never had more than 15 interceptions in any season) Perhaps we will see a regression in passing volume? He might be too overpriced because of the hype, but I'm looking to draft him in the same tier as the next guy.</p>

					<h5>Drew Brees - NO - 2 years, $50 million, $25 million fully guaranteed</h5>
					<p>I know we all know what this means for the team. He's continued his fantasy greatness with the Saints for over a decade, and they continue to add pieces around him within the offense. With Emmanuel Sanders signing a two-year deal, he will add depth and some competition to that WR2 spot. The Saints resigned, starting guard Andrus Peat to a long term deal, solidifying another starter to protect Brees. They also drafted center Cesar Ruiz in the first round as a depth piece. The ingredients are there for another top 10 season, but will they need 300 yards and multiple touchdowns to win the game?</p>
					<p>In 2018, the Saints were 13-3 and made it to the NFC championship game. Brees threw for nearly 4000 yards and 32 touchdowns that season. It sounds like another great year as expected, but let's take a closer look. In 15 games, he had less than 220 passing yards and only one touchdown in five. He also had three more games under 250 passing yards and two touchdowns. The Saints can win in the regular season with the running game leading the charge. Our next guy further supports this claim as he went undefeated for five games when starting in place for the injured Brees. Because of this, I can't be comfortable seeing him as a weekly starter until he proves me wrong. I will patiently wait until week 16 when he gets 200 yards and no touchdowns because Alvin Kamara scores twice, and Will Lutz kicks four field goals to say that I warned you.</p>


					<h5>Teddy Bridgewater - CAR - 3 years, $63 million, $33 million fully guaranteed</h5>

					<p>
End of an era. With Cam Newton, a free agent and new head coach Matt Rhule, this offense will change, and we have no idea what to expect. Because of how last year played out for the Panthers, this move feels like an upgrade at quarterback. Teddy admirably filled in as a starter for the Saints last season, where they went 5-1 due to injury. However, during this span, he threw more than 250 yards only twice while also throwing for less than 200 twice in five starts on a team with Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara.
</p>
<p>Now he's throwing it to D.J. Moore, CMC, Curtis Samuel, and newly acquired Robby Anderson. That's a lot of speed and big-play ability for someone not known to often throw the deep ball. Teddy's 7.1 yards per attempt in 2019 ranks somewhere in the middle among his peers, so the hope is he'll break into the top 10 this upcoming season. If not, it will require consistent volume and efficiency from Teddy to be a weekly start. With the retirement of Luke Kuechly, they went out and rebuilt their defense by spending all seven of their picks on defensive players. Teddy may be a low floor weekly streamer, but I'm not buying any shares until I see it first.</p>

<h5>Kirk Cousins - MIN - 2-year extension, $66 million, $31 fully guaranteed.</h5>
<p>When the Vikings decided to sign Kirk to that three-year $84 million contract, many speculated that they overpaid for an average at best quarterback. I was one of them, and I can admit that I was wrong. Nearly averaging 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns in his two seasons with them, he has shown the ability to be an above-average quarterback. He can make all the throws, further evidenced by his 69.1% completion rate (top five in 2019). The problem is he doesn't get the opportunity (24th in total passing attempts). It's hard to be a top 10 quarterback when you have fewer attempts than Jacoby Brissett and Jimmy Garoppolo. </p>
<p>With head coach Mike Zimmer and offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak, we can expect the team to continue leaning on Dalvin Cook, opening up the play-action for Cousins and Thielen. Nothing confirms this more than the blockbuster trade of Stefon Diggs to the Bills and the signing of Tajae Sharpe, which is an apparent lateral move. They drafted receiver Justin Jefferson in the first round, who excelled in the slot. Also, multiple new offensive line pieces provide depth, and a repeat of 2019 looks more probable than before. With the third-lowest total passing attempts last year, the odds are high that they will finish in the bottom five again this year. Cousins will be a strong streamer in good matchups, but that floor prevents him from being a weekly start.</p>
