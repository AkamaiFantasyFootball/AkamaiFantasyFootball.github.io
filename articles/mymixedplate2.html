					<h2>My Mixed Plate - 2020</h2>

				<div class="blog_content_wrap">
					<p>If you’re not from Hawaii or have never visited, the terms “mixed plate” or “plate lunch” means a meal made up of entrees and sides.  Mixed Plates are usually larger than your average plate lunch but considered plate lunches too.</p>
					<p>I wanted to make a list of guys I’m targeting in every draft regardless of scoring formats within a standard roster format (QB/RB/RB/WR/WR/TE/WRT Flex). Using tiers to categorize players’ groups, I will explain my general roster construction strategy for 2020 and compare them to typical entrees and sides on my <b>mixed plate</b> for 2020.</p>

					<h5>White Rice - Wide Receivers</h5>
					<p>While boring by itself, it plays a vital role because it needs to go with everything else on the plate and is one of the plate’s larger portions. Eating overcooked/undercooked rice almost ruins the entire plate lunch despite being one of the most straightforward items to prepare correctly. Because of that, there’s a small chance that you’ll come across it, but not often enough to worry. </p>
					<p>Wide Receivers this year have been as deep as ever with the consensus of drafting running backs early since there is plenty of talent to choose from later in the draft. Many of them are projected to finish closely among each other, providing a surplus mentality among fantasy owners. While the depth among receivers is more extensive than previous years, there are still a few players that I believe are values and will provide that perfectly cooked rice that will complement any roster.</p>
					<b>Targeted Players:</b>
					<p><table>
						<thead>
							<tr><th>Name</th>
								<th>Team</th>
								<th>Projected ADP</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Adam Thielen</td>
								<td>MIN</td>
								<td>WR 12/13</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Calvin Ridley</td>
								<td>ATL</td>
								<td>WR 16/17</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Tyler Lockett</td>
								<td>SEA</td>
								<td>WR 19/20</td>

							<tr>
								<td>Michael Gallup</td>
								<td>DAL</td>
								<td>WR 28/29</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Marquise Brown</td>
								<td>BAL</td>
								<td>WR 29/30</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table></p>
			

					<h5>Entree: Chicken Karaage/Teri Beef/Ahi Katsu - Running Backs</h5>

					<p>An essential part of the plate lunch, the entree(s) are the star of the show. Usually, it’s some form of meat or a medley of vegetables that provides the main attraction.</p>
					<p>This year, the consensus strategy is to focus on running backs in the early rounds. Because of the depth at other positions, it’s crucial to get the running backs that you like and fit your team’s construction. The same benchmark does not determine every running back’s value; therefore it’s essential to have a loose idea on what kind of players you are targeting. I will go into depth in the future on the various roles running backs can have and how it affects them in fantasy football. Until then, I’ll state the type of guys I’m targeting. I want a player with opportunity, shown that they can produce, and are being slightly undervalued. </p>

							<tr><th>Name</th>
								<th>Team</th>
								<th>Projected ADP</th>

								<td>LAC</td>
								<td>RB 12/13</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table></p>


					<h5>Macaroni Salad (Tight End)</h5>

					<p>Macaroni Salad or “mac salad” is a secondary but still necessary side dish to the plate lunch. Many places prepare it the same way while some add some vegetables to make it unique. For the most part, I like the majority of mac salads that I come across, although I do not hesitate to substitute for more rice or tossed salad if I don’t enjoy a certain one. </p>
					<p>Tight ends fit this category to me because there are a few that I like and will target, but if I don’t get them, then everyone else is closely-ranked together, and I have no strong preference between them. </p>
					<p><b>Targeted Players:</b></p>

										<p><table>
						<thead>
							<tr><th>Name</th>
								<th>Team</th>
								<th>Projected ADP</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Mark Andrews</td>
								<td>BAL</td>
								<td>TE 3/4</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Darren Waller</td>
								<td>LV</td>
								<td>TE 6</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Mike Gesicki</td>
								<td>MIA</td>
								<td>TE 14/15</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Jonnu Smith</td>
								<td>TEN</td>
								<td>TE 17/18</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table></p>

										<h5>Drink (Quarterback)</h5>
					<p>I must confess that I usually didn’t get a drink with any of my plate lunches growing up. I would either be eating them at home or just have a cup of water to save money. With that said, having a drink is still important. For some, they need to have their favorite soda/juice. Others are fine with any soda or tea. It all depends on the player and their preferences. </p>
					<p>Quarterbacks are like drinks to me because it doesn’t matter what kind of drink you have. Of course, I have my soda/juice preferences, but will I not dehydrate myself because my favorite choices aren’t available. Sometimes, all we need is some clean water, and fortunately is available for me in the waiver wire or last rounds. </p>
