					<p>As I make my projections, there are always unique discrepancies between the consensus rankings and my own. Sometimes, they can be negligible, and others are vast. This year, I found four players whom I have a larger discrepancy on where they should be ranked (Half PPR). Two will be players I have ranked higher than consensus and two will be lower. </p>
					
					<h5>Underrated</h5>

					<h5>Darren Waller - NYG (13)</h5>
					<p>After a rough season last year due to injuries (missing practically half the season), he is looking to bounce back to his 2020 form on a new roster as one of the primary receiving threats in the offense. Sure, they don’t pass the ball a lot, and Daniel Jones isn’t considered a great option, so the uncertainty is warranted. However, this team had no receiver surpassing 750 yards and only one player with more than 75 targets (Saquon Barkley). He will likely finish in the top two in targets, and if he can remain healthy, he can be a stable top-five TE on a weekly basis. He may not have the upside of Travis Kelce or Mark Andrews, but he will be consistently targeted and provide a higher floor than you could expect from players like Kyle Pitts and Dallas Goedert. He’s currently being drafted among names like Pitts, Goedert, and George Kittle and sometimes is the last of the four. I am looking to draft him if he and one of the other players are remaining to ensure that I have someone with enough upside to finish in the top three. </p>

					
					<h5>Tyler Higbee - LAR (10)</h5>
					<p> Finishing as a top-ten TE last season in half PPR, he’s currently drafted outside of the top ten behind names like Pat Freiermuth, Evan Engram, and David Njoku. However, I think he’s being undervalued as one of the primary receiving threats within the offense behind Cooper Kupp. Sure, he’s not better than those players, but I don’t think he’s a tier below them, either. Higbee led the team in targets last season and surpassed 60 receptions in three of the past four seasons. Sure, Cooper Kupp and Matthew Stafford got injured in the previous year, but even if his target share declines, he should still have enough volume to be a threat to finish in the top ten at the end of the season. There is no clear #2 receiving option within the offense, and he will have games finishing in the top five in his position. Of course, his lack of touchdowns and reliance on volume will limit his upside. Still, if you’re in the double-digit rounds, he is not a bad consolation prize, considering he will likely continue with another 60 receptions, 600 yards, and a few touchdowns. </p>
				

					<h5>Overrated</h5>


					<h5>T.J. Hockenson - MIN (13)</h5>
					<p>My issue is not with the player; it’s when he’s considered the clear 3rd best option in drafts and a tier ahead of everyone else. If we were to guarantee that Hockenson would repeat 90% of what he did in the second half of last season, then I can understand why he’s the consensus third TE in drafts. He was incredibly impressive, finishing with at least eight targets in seven of the last ten games last season, and had at least five catches and 40 yards in six of those ten games. He failed to finish in the top five in the position except for once during those games, and I think he’s not much better than Darren Waller or George Kittle despite their flaws. The team also added a rookie WR in the first round to replace the production of Adam Thelien; however, it’s also possible that he will limit Hockenson’s volume, which lowers his floor every week. I have no problem drafting him in the middle rounds, but if I have to grab him a round early, I would instead invest in a player like Travis Kelce or Mark Andrews.  </p>

					<h5>Chigoziem Okonkwo - TEN (7)</h5>
					<p>I understand the upside during the offseason, and the hype pretty much died down when the team acquired Deandre Hopkins. Even with the injury to Treylon Burks, I’m just not comfortable considering Okonkwo anything more than a high-upside dart throw in the double-digit rounds. Drafted outside of the top 12 and, for the most part, appropriately valued. However, I think he should be drafted outside of the top 15 because I don’t believe we’ll be able to start him on a weekly basis. This offense finished in the bottom five in passing yards and touchdowns, and I don’t expect this to change. Unless Treylon Burks misses half of the season, I will likely not be high enough to draft him over other options like Cole Kmet, Dalton Schultz, and Greg Dulcich.</p>
