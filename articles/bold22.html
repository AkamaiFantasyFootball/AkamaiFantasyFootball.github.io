					<p>When making bold predictions, I find that some people don't fully understand what makes a bold prediction valuable. For example, saying, "Player X can finish within the top 12." isn't helpful unless you explain the range of outcomes and how probable that outcome is. It also doesn't help if that player is a consensus-ranked top 15 receiver. Obviously, this isn't called conservative predictions, so there needs to be a balance. I will attempt to provide a balanced argument on these three players who I believe are undervalued and can help you win your league.</p>

					<h5>Marquise "Hollywood" Brown will finish a top 15 WR</h5> 
					<p>As I drafted half of the leagues I signed up for, I've been pleasantly surprised to be leaving with Brown on my roster as my WR2 in a couple of them. He's someone that will immediately be within range of a top 12-15 WR within the first half of the season, with Deandre Hopkins suspended and re-acclimating himself to his normal expectations. Last season, we saw a glimpse of how it would get distributed for four games last season near the end of the year (Weeks 15-18). Christian Kirk finished with 12, 9, and 9 targets during the first three games. In the playoffs against the LAR, he was targeted 11 times as the lead target on the offense. While it's crucial to note Zach Ertz also finished with 11, 13, and 9 targets in those same games with Kirk, showing that Kyler Murray can support both a WR1 and a top 12 TE on a week-by-week basis. </p>

					<p>Over the last two seasons, Lamar Jackson's passing volume has been drastically different from each other. In 2020, he averaged 26 passing attempts per game compared to 32 last season. Granted, the team was dealing with significant injuries to their RBs, so the game plan had to be changed. Let's estimate between 29-30 attempts this season. How much does Kyler Murray average over the same span? Somewhere between 33-34. Safe to say, Kyler will be throwing the ball more than Lamar would. Comparing efficiency numbers will show that Lamar has about a 64% completion rate while Kyler is around 67-69%. Of course, these superficial comparisons don't mean Brown is on a better offense. Still, I think they will utilize him differently than during his time in Baltimore, allowing him to be more productive with the targets he's getting. </p>

					<p>The question is what to expect when Hopkins returns and returns to his WR1 status of double-digit targets every game. Or is it...? During those ten games last season, he only finished with nine or more targets in three games. While he did score eight touchdowns, he also exceeded 70 receiving yards only twice. But, of course, he had eleven games with at least nine targets the year prior. So all I'm saying is that it's not guaranteed that Hopkins will be the clear #1 option every game. Instead, I think there will be matchups where Brown will be more of a 1B within the offense. With players like Tee Higgins, Mike Williams, and Jaylen Waddle hovering around the top 15, I believe Brown should be within this tier and is a value being drafted a round after those players.</p>

					<h5>Rashaad Penny and Kenneth Walker will both finish outside the top 36 RB</h5>
					<p>This might not be a "bold" prediction, as they are generally being drafted outside of the top 30 RB except for Rashaad Penny by some. It is understandable if Kenneth Walker misses more time than anticipated. I'm curious why he's not currently on the PUP list with no timetable for his return. I'm guessing that it's likely that he will return before Week 5, so this supports my above point earlier. The main reason why I think neither RB will finish within the top 36 is that they will be in a committee for one of the worse offenses in the league. Unfortunately, I don't believe the SEA offense will be able to support a committee without them cannibalizing each other's upside. If Kenneth Walker were to go on the PUP list, I would have at least a month where Rashaad Penny is the clear #1 option.</p>

					<p> Rebuilding their roster, I'm not expecting the Seahawks to be above 500 or fighting for second place in the division. I think it's clear that we can expect a negative game script for the rushing offense, as they will be down in most games. Even with the run-heavy game script that I expect from head coach Pete Carroll, I don't anticipate 35-40 carries between them when they're down by two touchdowns in the 3rd quarter. I think with Walker healthy, it could be a matchup-based split weekly. In the four games that Geno Smith started last season (small sample size, I know), the RB position ran: 20, 26, 23, and 22. They won the last game 31-7 and still ran the ball less than 25 times. With Penny and Chris Carson hurt, Alex Collins was the clear lead back but split carries with Penny when he returned. Travis Homer and Deejay Dallas also saw a carry or two.  </p>

					<p>I'm sure you didn't need me to tell you that starting a SEA RB during those four weeks was tough. While it should be better this season, they drafted some pieces to the offensive line, and I think they will have games where they finish within the top 24. But, with so many questions and uncertainties, it just feels like a dice roll rather than a coin toss. Unfortunately, the dice have more disappointing outcomes than positive ones compared to other players.</p>
					
					<h5>Robert Woods or Michael Gallup will finish in the top 24, and both will finish as top-30 WR.</h5>
					<p>This one is something I've noticed near the end of my drafts this past weekend (sorry, it doesn't quite apply now), but these players were my WR 4/5 on 0.5/full PPR leagues where they are not expected to start right away. But, of course, they each have their concerns that limit their upside or give us more questions on a week-to-week basis on whether we can trust them as a starting WR. </p>

					<p>For Woods, it is the role within the offense on a run-heavy team that lost its best WR in the off-season. The team drafted Treylon Burks in the first round, and he will compete for targets within the offense; however, in 2020, Ryan Tannehill targeted two WRs nearly 100 times (106,92 - Brown/Davis), with Jonnu Smith and Anthony Firsker combining for over 100 targets. That was with Derrick Henry playing 16 games that season as well.</p>

					<p>Last season three guys were filling in the WR2 role, whether it's Julio, Westbrook-Ikhine, or Chester Rogers. With the two WRs locked down within the offense, I think target distribution will be similar to 2020, with two WRs leading the target share at 110/120 each. Remember, Woods averaged around 90 catches, 1,000 yds, and four TDs over the past three seasons with 130/140 targets. If we get 80 catches, 875 yds, and four TDs in the 9th round of a PPR draft, that's fine with me. If he finishes with six or seven touchdowns, he may sneak into top 24 WR territory, but the top 30 is where I think he could finish. </p>

					<p>Michael Gallup's most significant concern are the questions regarding his health and when he will play. He seems to be returning within four games since he's not on the PUP list, and if he's able to return to form after a month, he will have an excellent opportunity to finish the 2nd half within the top 24 WR based on matchups. Coming into the WR2 role on the team, with Amari Cooper and Cedrick Wilson gone, the team drafted a rookie to add depth, but there's still a good chunk of those 165 vacated targets that will go to Gallup (62 in nine games). That's possibly 115 -125 targets (assuming he misses a couple of games) for a guy you're getting at the end of the draft. He's been a 1,000-yard receiver in his career once before, and I think he'll reach it, despite missing a couple of games early in the season. </p>

					<p>Sure Ceedee Lamb, Dalton Schultz, Tony Pollard, and Zeke may all have more targets, but Lamb already finished with 120, Schultz already was over 100 targets last year; Pollard and Zeke combined for over 110+ targets, with Gallup hurt for half of the season. Add the 160+ vacated targets, and even if a little more than half of it goes to everyone else, that's still within the 130-135 target upside. If he gets close, a top 24 WR finish is possible if he gets lucky and scores nine TDs, but he reminds me of Mike Williams type of player before the breakout season. He will have some boom-or-bust games, but the floor is high because he is being drafted late. </p>
