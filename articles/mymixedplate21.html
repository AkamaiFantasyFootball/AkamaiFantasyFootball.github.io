					<h2>My Mixed Plate - 2021</h2>

				<div class="blog_content_wrap">
					<p>If you’re not from Hawaii or have never visited, the terms “mixed plate” or “plate lunch” means a meal made up of entrees and sides.  Mixed Plates are usually larger than your average plate lunch but are considered plate lunches too.</p>
					<p>Like last year, I'm making a list of guys I'm targeting in every draft regardless of scoring formats within a standard roster format (QB/RB/RB/WR/WR/TE/WRT Flex). Using tiers to categorize players' groups, I will explain my general roster construction strategy for 2021 and compare them to typical entrees and sides on my <b>mixed plate</b> for 2021.</p>

					<h5>White Rice - Wide Receivers</h5>
					<p>While it is boring alone, it plays a vital role because it needs to go with everything else on the plate and is one of the more significant portions of the meal. Eating overcooked/undercooked rice almost ruins the entire plate lunch despite being one of the most straightforward items to prepare correctly. Because of that, you don't want to take a chance on somewhere that messes up the rice since it's practically expected to not deal with it in decent restaurants. </p>
					<p>Wide Receivers are compared to rice within the metaphorical plate lunch because there are many quality options available. You can't expect to compete for a championship without a decent WR core. There's a general narrative that a good strategy is to draft RBs within the first two rounds and then add WRs within the mid-rounds (3-7) shortly after. Many of them are projected to finish closely among each other, providing a surplus mentality among fantasy owners, and tier-based drafting becomes more valuable. While the depth among receivers is extensive, I believe a few players are valuable and will provide that perfectly cooked rice that will complement any roster. </p>

					<h5>Entree: Chicken Karaage/Teri Beef/Ahi Katsu - Running Backs</h5>

					<p>An essential part of the plate lunch, the entree(s), is the show's big star. Usually, it's some form of meat or a medley of vegetables that provides the main attraction. Many places make similar dishes with their own twist on the recipe or combine two different meals to create a unique fusion. As the star of the dish, they make or break the entire meal. Some places are locally known for specific dishes that can't be found anywhere else. </p>
					<p>The narrative of drafting RBs early will apply again this year. Unless you're in a PPR league, it would be difficult for me to draft a WR within the first round. Because of the depth at other positions, the scarcity of finding an RB without multiple question marks drives the value up. After that, it becomes a question of what attributes you value the most. From projected role within the offense to the potential upside/downside risk and the off-season narrative, all play a role throughout the offseason. It's essential to have a loose idea of what kind of players you are targeting to keep track of specific guys you are higher/lower on. Personally, I want a player with opportunity, shown the ability they can produce, and slightly undervalued. </p>

					<h5>Macaroni Salad/Side Salad (Tight End)</h5>

					<p>Macaroni Salad or “mac salad” is a secondary but necessary side dish to the plate lunch. Many places prepare it the same way, while some add some vegetables to make it unique. For the most part, I like the majority of mac salads that I come across, although I do not hesitate to substitute for more rice or tossed greens if I don’t enjoy a certain one. </p>
					<p>Tight ends fit this category because there are a few that I like and will target, but if I don't get them, then everyone else is closely ranked together, and I have no strong preference between them except for a select few. This season is slightly different from the consensus top-3 options, with Travis Kelce the clear first option; however, I don't have a strong preference between those three and would be happy to grab either guy within their ADP. </p>

								<td>Tyler Higbee</td>
								<td>LAR</td>
								<td>TE 11/12</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table></p>

										<h5>Drink (Quarterback)</h5>
					<p>I must confess that I usually didn’t get a drink with any of my plate lunches growing up. I would either be eating them at home or just have water to save money. With that said, having a drink is still important. For some, they need to have their favorite soda/juice. Others are fine with any soda or tea. It all depends on the manager and their preferences. </p>
					<p>Quarterbacks are comparable to drinks because it's easier for me to decide what I don't want rather than what I like best. Of course, I have my soda/juice preferences, but I will not dehydrate myself because my favorite choices aren't available. Sometimes, all we need is some clean water and fortunately is available for me in the waiver wire or later rounds. </p>
