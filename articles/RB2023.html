					<p>As I make my projections, there are always unique discrepancies between the consensus rankings and my own. Sometimes, they can be negligible, and others are vast. This year, I found eight players whom I have a larger discrepancy on where they should be ranked (Half PPR). Four will be players I have ranked higher than consensus and four will be lower. </p>
					
					<h5>Underrated</h5>

					<h5>Derrick Henry - TEN (7)</h5>
					<p>Obviously, we can agree he’s a great player, but the first question people ask is, “Could this be the year he falls off?” With three of his last four seasons (missed eight games in 2021) surpassing 300 carries, he’s been the centerpiece of the offense. At age 29, this could be the year we see some decline, and many people are afraid of what could happen and would rather draft a younger RB. However, not having him as a top-five RB is extreme, and I personally have him in the top three. The team added Deandre Hopkins and rookie RB Tyjae Spears, which could limit his volume, but I would argue it improves his efficiency and the entire offense. This should give them more opportunities at the red zone, which could help Henry surpass the 13 touchdowns he had last season. Even if Henry finishes with 280 touches, he has the potential to finish as the RB1, and he could fall into the second round. If I’m drafting near the turn, he’s an easy first-round pick to build the foundational piece of my roster. </p>

					
					<h5>James Conner - AZ (14)</h5>
					<p> There’s undoubtedly a few question marks on why I’m so high on James Conner. He’s missed time with injuries and is on a projected bad offense, while Kyler Murray is injured. The lack of upside does concern me, and I’m not denying that the offense will struggle early in the season. We remember how it was last year in the second half of the season. Over the previous eight games (minus Week 18), he surpassed 60 rushing yards in six of those games, scored six touchdowns, and averaged four catches. He also finished in the top ten in four games and never fell below the top 24, making him a solid RB2. Too bad we can’t predict some form of that this season since it’s totally different. He’s drafted outside the top 20, and I believe he’s a bit underrated (WR since the offense isn’t too inspiring. They showed a commitment to running the ball last season, and with Murray injured, I don’t think it will be drastically different. James Conner is also a receiving threat, making him game-script proof when the team is forced to pass in situations. </p>
				

					<h5>Antonio Gibson - WAS (14)</h5>
					<p> I was surprised to see this name as high as he was, and I wondered if I overestimated how many touches Brian Robinson would have. People underestimate how involved he will be in the passing game. For the record, I have him as my RB29 in half PPR, and I have seen him fall outside of the top 36. It isn’t a considerable discrepancy, but when you’re looking for a flex option in the middle rounds, I find myself drafting him as my RB3 in PPR leagues. I admit he’s facing tough competition with Terry McLaurin and Jahan Dotson as the primary receiving threats. However, I think the role for the third option is open between Gibson and Curtis Samuel. I think Gibson is the better player, which explains why I’m higher on him since I believe he will provide weekly value as a flex option while having some upside if he takes away some touches from Robinson. It isn’t a great offense, but his versatility with new offensive coordinator Eric Bienemy gives me optimism that it will improve from last season. </p>

					<h5>Raheem Mostert - MIA (10)</h5>
					<p> As we get lower into the rankings, it’s easier to forgive when there’s a discrepancy between players. But I was confused when I saw Mostert as the third RB drafted on the team. Sure, the addition of rookie RB De’von Achane doesn’t help the already small rushing volume in Miami’s offense. Achane and Jeff Wilson will have touches in every game this season, but having Mostert as the bottom option when he was the starter last season is ridiculous. The injury concerns and age are legitimate concerns for why his role may change; however, he doesn’t need 15 touches to make an impact. He just needs one opportunity to make a big play, and he gives you the upside to win you a week as a bye week fill-in or an RB4 with the upside to be an RB2 (finishing in the top 24 six times last season). In the double-digit rounds, he’s been someone I’ve found myself drafting as a possible flex option early in the season with Achane hurt.  </p>


					<h5>Overrated</h5>


					<h5>Jonathan Taylor - IND (11)</h5>
					<p>Last season was tricky due to a couple of injuries and the offense struggling behind Matt Ryan. Recovering from off-season surgery, Taylor has been frustrated with contract negotiations and has been at the forefront of trade rumors. The team with a new head coach also drafted a rookie QB who is a capable rushing threat and limited as a passer. While the presence of another rushing threat helps open up things for Taylor, I also believe there’s a real threat of losing red-zone opportunities and the touchdowns that come with it. The team also drafted a rookie RB to contribute on passing downs, and if Taylor isn’t healthy by Week 1, he could be over-valued as a top-five RB. I’m personally more comfortable drafting him at the beginning of the 3rd round after guys like Derrick Henry, Saquon Barkley, and Tony Pollard. He has the talent to finish the RB1, but I would prefer another option in the first two rounds with all the uncertainty on the roster and his health. </p>

					<h5>Travis Etienne - JAX (9)</h5>
					<p>Coming off an injury in his rookie season, he showed the upside of an RB1, finishing with over 100 rushing yards in five games. He also finished with less than 50 rushing yards in seven games. He scored a touchdown in four games and didn’t surpass 45 receiving yards in any games last season. The positive is that he looked healthy, and when given the volume, he usually delivered a top-24 performance. However, the team added WR Calvin Ridley and drafted rookie RB Tank Bigsby. Typically, the addition of playmakers would help the overall offense and efficiency. However, I also think an offense with Calvin Ridley, Christian Kirk, and Evan Engram will make it harder for Etienne to match the 45 targets he had last season. I also believe Bigsby to be a competent backup that can threaten for some early down touches. He’s currently being drafted as high as the 3rd round, and I personally wouldn’t consider him until the 4th after names like Najee Harris, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Aaron Jones. He certainly has the upside, but I think drafting him at the 3rd means he has to hit it to provide a good value.</p>

					<h5>J.K. Dobbins - BAL (13)</h5>
					<p>Coming off injury in 2021, last season, we saw some flashes of his pre-injury self, finishing with over 100 rushing yards in two of his previous four games. With another off-season to recover, he could become a top-20 RB if he stays healthy. However, I think the upside isn’t that high, and I have some question marks on what the offense will look like with the new offensive coordinator. The team added Odell Beckham Jr. and drafted rookie WR Zay Flowers in the first round to show their commitment to improving the passing game. Like many, I think the rushing volume will decrease, which limits his upside, but he will also be in a committee with Lamar Jackson and Gus Edwards. While I’m not too concerned about Gus Edwards, I don’t have the confidence that he will have enough volume and red-zone opportunities to finish within the top 24. I have him as my RB26, so it’s not like I think he’s going to bust, but I would prefer names such as Alvin Kamara, Dameon Pierce, and James Conner.</p>

					<h5>James Cook - BUF (13)</h5>
					<p>Like my opinion on J.K. Dobbins, he won’t be a bust by any means. But I think people are overestimating the upside of a lead RB in a committee where the biggest rushing weapon is the QB. However, I also believe that Damien Harris will be more involved in the earlier downs than people think. Cook finished with double-digit carries four times last season, and he looked like a solid flex option when given those opportunities. With Devin Singletary gone, it’s easy to see why everyone is so high on him, especially since Harris isn’t a receiving threat. However, the main issue we had with Singletary still plagues Cook, and while he may become a better player, I don’t see a pathway for him to exceed his ADP. Don’t forget that they drafted TE Dalton Kincaid in the first round as an additional receiving threat to compete for targets. If he’s your RB3 in PPR leagues, that’s fine, but I would prefer players like Isaiah Pacheco or Antonio Gibson.</p>
