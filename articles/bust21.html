					<p>Sometimes there are players that the consensus is high on, but you're just sitting here wondering what you're missing out on.  It's not that you don't like the player; it's just the perceived value is not worth the risk. Whether it'd be the role within the offense or health/injuries concerns, there are many variables that we subjectively value more than others when determining "busts." So instead of saying these players will outright fail, I'm never going to have them on my teams this season at their current ADP.</p>
					

					<h5>Brandon Aiyuk (WR) - SF (6)</h5>
					<p>For the record, I believe in the talent and the potential upside with Aiyuk. Deebo's injury concerns, Trey Lance may be starting, and another year under Shanahan's system are all signs that this may be the breakout year for the first-round pick in 2019. He should be drafted ahead of Deebo, who is hovering around the top 36 WR. Aiyuk is currently within the top 24, if not right outside of it, and I believe you're paying a fair price for the breakout year. </p>

					<p>If we get 75% of that breakout production, he will disappoint fantasy managers who took him around players like Tee Higgins and Chase Claypool. With Deebo and Kittle are returning from injuries, Aiyuk's target share should be smaller even if Deebo is the third option on a run-heavy offense. If they both play at least 12 games each, I can't see a path of Aiyuk exceeding the high expectations of a week-to-week WR2.</p>
					
					<h5>Joe Burrow (QB) - CIN (10)</h5>
					<p>When drafting a young QB returning from a devastating knee injury, you don't want them to be in a division where every team has a good defense. So that's nearly a third of the season facing formidable defenses and relying on a second-year QB on a rebuilding team to provide top 12 QB production? He's currently drafted within the top 12, ahead of guys like Matt Ryan and Teddy Bridgewater, who could outperform him against those problematic matchups. He averaged less than two passing touchdowns per game last season with nearly 40 attempts in a handful of games.  The team did add Jamarr Chase and brought some depth to the offensive line, but these moves should not immediately catapult Burrow into a weekly starter in single QB leagues. </p>
				

					<h5>Najee Harris (RB) - PIT (7)</h5>
					<p>This is hard for me to write, as I really like him and believe he has RB1 upside as the lead back by a large margin. He's a capable receiver and has an excellent opportunity to be a three-down back. But going ahead of guys like Joe Mixon, Chris Carson, and Clyde Edwards-Helaire feels too rich for my blood. Like how I think about Aiyuk, you're paying the price for the upside when it's not guaranteed. The downside of a mid-tier RB2 is possible and wouldn't sour me on him at all on his promising future. </p>

					<p>He's coming to an offense retooling their veteran offensive line that helped Leveon Bell and James Conner reach RB1 value in their peak seasons. The team also resigned Juju Smith-Schuster keeping three talented receivers showing their commitment to their pass-heavy offense (1st in passing attempts, 28th in rushing attempts last season). Big Ben is another year older, and I don't see the offense drastically changing with all the roster moves, which makes me miss out on Harris in every draft. </p>
