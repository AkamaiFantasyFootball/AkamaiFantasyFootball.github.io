					<h2>Who Did I Draft? - 2021</h2>

				<div class="blog_content_wrap">
					<p>In my second year of doing double-digit fantasy football leagues, I'm more prepared and ready for the assortment of confusion among scoring settings, draft position, and bench spots that come with this. At this current point, I've drafted eight of the most competitive out of my ten leagues. I have come with the results of who I've drafted the most across many settings: half/full PPR & standard scoring, 6 points per passing TD, 2 QB/Superflex, auction drafts, and tight end premium scoring. This year, I either had a top 3 pick or was near, if not the turn pick.  When drafting, I had an idea of who my guys were, but every draft was different, and I surprised myself with who I had despite where I had them projected in my rankings. If you followed me last season, there might be a familiar name or two, so you shouldn't be surprised if they reappear.</p>

					<h5>Quarterback (amount of teams)</h5>
					<p><ul><li>Josh Allen (2)</li><li>Tom Brady (2)</li><li>Matt Ryan (2)</li><li>Ryan Tannehill (2)</li><li>Daniel Jones (2)</li></ul></p>
					<p>I wanted Josh Allen but ending up satisfied with Brady and Tannehill in most of my leagues with Ryan and Jones as backups. Again, like in my mixed plate article, there are preferences, but the production is generally replaceable, especially in single QB leagues.</p>

					<h5>Running Back (amount of teams)</h5>
					<p><ul><li>Darrell Henderson (3)</li><li>James Robinson (3)</li><li>Dalvin Cook (2)</li><li>Joe Mixon (2)</li><li>Raheem Mostert (2)</li><li>Nick Chubb (2)</li><li>Jonathan Taylor (2)</li><li>Miles Sanders (2)</li><li>Kareem Hunt (2)</li></ul></p>
					<p>If I had an early pick, I would end up with Cook or Taylor/Chubb/Mixon if it was at the turn. I often found Robinson as my RB2 with either Henderson or Sanders as my RB3/flex. I was initially expecting to have Aaron Jones on more of my rosters. However, I had to adjust, and that's why you need to always have a backup plan if your guy gets taken before you.</p>

					<h5>Wide Receiver (amount of teams)</h5>
					<p><ul><li>Tee Higgins (4)</li><li>Odell Beckham Jr. (4)</li><li>Russell Gage (4)</li><li>Amari Cooper (3)</li><li>Tyler Boyd (3)</li><li>Antonio Brown (3)</li><li>Michael Thomas (3)</li><li>Allen Robinson (2)</li><li>Chris Godwin (2)</li></ul></p>
					<p>Since I would sometimes draft three RBs within the first four rounds, my WRs would be drafted within the middle rounds, searching for the best value amongst them. Unfortunately, I would find guys with question marks (OBJ/Michael Thomas) or not the clear-cut first receiving option (Godwin/Boyd/Amari Cooper/Higgins) in this area. Because of this, I ended up taking more risks than I anticipated to help make up for the lack of a top 10 WR on my roster. However, I believe in their talent, and the potential upside outweighs the foreseeable risk at their ADP.
</p>

					<h5>Tight End (amount of teams)</h5>
					<p><ul><li>Mark Andrews (5)</li><li>Blake Jarwin (2)</li><li>Zach Ertz (2)</li></ul></p>
					<p>I still like Mark Andrews alot. I also like Ertz/Jarwin as a TE2 option in the last two rounds of my drafts (deep bench).</p>
