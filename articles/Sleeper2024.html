					<p>As I make my projections, there are always unique discrepancies between the consensus rankings and my own. Sometimes, they can be negligible, and others are vast. There are also potential league winners who are drafted in the double-digit rounds or not drafted at all. We won't always identify them, but if we try, we may get lucky and find one. Here are a few names of some guys I'm interested in drafting with my last couple of picks as potential flex options depending on my team's situation. </p>
					

					<h5>Joshua Palmer- LAC (5)</h5>
					<p>With the departure of Keenan Allen, Austin Ekeler, and Mike Williams, the team decided to draft rookie WR Ladd McConkey and sign D.J. Chark to help compensate for 250 vacated targets. Even if both players are involved, and the RBs have a couple of opportunities, that still leaves at least 70 targets up for grabs. With half of that, he would approach 100 targets, and the last time he did (2022), he finished with 72 catches for 769 yards and three touchdowns. What happens if he gets five touchdowns this year? When he's going in the last few rounds, and I'm drafting my final WR, he's a solid option that could be a flex option during the season.  </p>

					
					<h5>Rico Dowdle - DAL (7)</h5>
					<p>Behind Tony Pollard last season, he didn't look impressive enough to warrant more touches, which is concerning. However, after Pollard left, the team resigned Ezekiel Elliot. If they don't believe Dowdle can have a larger role in the offense, they would bring in someone with more upside. At least, you would think. Dowdle will not likely start at the beginning of the season, but if Dowdle gets 40% of the touches, he may be worthy of a roster spot. If he ever became the primary option, he would be a TD-dependent flex option. This is only appealing once you realize it's the DAL offense. I don't expect myself to draft him consistently, but he's someone I can cut if he doesn't show any promise in the first couple of weeks.</p>
				

					<h5>Jameson Williams - DET (5)</h5>
					<p>Entering his third season, Williams has a massive opportunity to solidify himself as a secondary receiving threat on a good offense. Behind Amon-Ra St. Brown, Sam LaPorta, and Jahmyr Gibbs, he doesn't have the upside to be a weekly starter, but as a fourth option, he could be a boom-or-bust flex option in favorable matchups. Josh Reynolds is gone, which frees up 64 targets. If Williams were to absorb most of those targets, he would have the upside to finish in the top 24 occasionally, which would be a good amount of upside in the double-digit rounds. The team didn't bring in additional competition, so they believe Williams can take the next step to be a consistent contributor. </p>

					<h5>Tyler Allgeier - ATL (12)</h5>
					<p>Not all handcuffs are created equal in the double-digit rounds. Some, like Tyler Allgeier, have proven capable backups as a 1,000-yard rusher in their rookie year. Not every handcuff will be productive when given the opportunity, and I believe Allgeier is. He took a step back last season but was involved as a secondary rusher behind Bijan Robinson with 186 carries. Allgeier will not see that type of volume with the new head coach and quarterback, but if you have a large bench, he would be a solid option in the double-digit rounds as your last RB on the team. After Week 1, you can cut him if he's only a handcuff, but if he does have a role within the offense, it may be worth holding on to see if it becomes a committee.</p>
