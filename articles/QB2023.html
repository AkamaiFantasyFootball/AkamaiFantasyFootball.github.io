					<p>As I make my projections, there are always unique discrepancies between the consensus rankings and my own. Sometimes, they can be negligible, and others are vast. This year, I found four players whom I have a larger discrepancy on where they should be ranked (6Pt Passing TD). Two will be players I have ranked higher than consensus and two will be lower. </p>
					
					<h5>Underrated</h5>

					<h5>Geno Smith - SEA (5)</h5>
					<p>Finishing in the top 6 in 2022, he’s drafted outside the top 12 quarterbacks in most leagues. He’s considered a regression candidate as a second-year starter. Still, the addition of rookie WR Jaxon Smith-Ngjiba and RB Zach Charbonnet gives the offense additional playmakers, along with D.K. Metcalf and Tyler Lockett returning. The team finished in the top ten in passing touchdowns and the upper half in passing yards last season and will likely remain in the same area this season. He had two or more passing touchdowns in 12 games last year, and eight of those games surpassing 250 passing yards. He finished in the top five of QBs four times last season and in the top 12 in ten games. While not much of a rushing threat, he provides value in the late rounds when you built a strong rotation of running backs and receivers. To get a 4,000-yard passer with around 26 touchdowns near the double-digit rounds is a solid consolation prize if you miss out on the top-tier options. In superflex leagues, he’s a top option to consider as a QB2 to pair with someone like Anthony Richardson/Tua Tagovailoa, who can provide more upside on a week-by-week basis. </p>

					
					<h5>Tua Tagovailoa - MIA (10)</h5>
					<p>With all the rightful question marks around his ability to stay healthy and lack of rushing threat, he still has Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle to throw to. Together, those two WRs combined for over 3,000 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns. Tua still finished as the QB15 despite missing 4.5 games last season. The team added a speed threat in De’von Achane and brought back the same RBs that led them to a top-five finish in passing yards. I expect the offense to remain pass-heavy (top ten in passing touchdowns last season), and if Tua can stay healthy, he has the potential to finish right outside of the top five. Currently, he’s being drafted around/after Deshaun Watson, Dak Prescott, and Aaron Rodgers, and I believe he will finish ahead of all those names if he plays 16 games this season (I’ll give him one). In superflex leagues, I think he’s a must-draft because of the upside he provides for his current ADP as a risky QB1 or top-tier QB2. In single QB leagues, he’s someone I would take if I miss out on players like Justin Herbert and Trevor Lawrence and will pair with another late-round QB like Jared Goff/Russell Wilson. </p>
				
					<h5>Overrated</h5>


					<h5>Deshaun Watson- CLE (5)</h5>
					<p>Historically, he’s been a top-five option while in Houston and showed flashes last season with a couple of solid performances in Weeks 17 and 18. However, for the most part, he looked awful. With an off-season behind him, he will look to bounce back to become one of the top ten quarterbacks this year, and his current ADP reflects that. He’s being drafted within the top ten ahead of guys like Aaron Rodgers, Kirk Cousins, and Daniel Jones. To me, that feels a bit pricey to draft him with the expectation that he returns to close of what he was in Houston. He does provide a rushing threat, which gives him the floor of a top-15 player. If things pan out, he has the upside to finish in the top eight. The team added a rookie WR (Cedric Tillman) to help the offense, but this is still a run-heavy offense with one of the best RBs in the league (Nick Chubb). Last season, they finished in the bottom ten in passing touchdowns and bottom 12 in passing yards. I’m confident they’ll be closer to the league average in 2023, but I don’t know how much patience I would have if he doesn’t show drastic improvement within the first couple of games. In superflex leagues, he’s someone I’m more comfortable with since I can pair him with a more stable option. But in single QB leagues, I wouldn’t feel satisfied with Watson as my Week 1 starter, which makes the draft capital a slight overpay when safer options are available.</p>

					<h5>Anthony Richardson - IND (11)</h5>
					<p>I think you can see the pattern with the two quarterbacks I’m not confident about. It’s a simple case of uncertainty and overvaluing upside. Obviously, the upside is there, and he has the rushing ability to be an immediate top-12 QB in fantasy football. However, he’s a rookie QB and is projected to struggle against most defenses as a raw and limited passer (at least in the first few games). Drafted outside of the top 12, which is reasonable, but I have him on the cusp of falling out of the top 15, behind names like Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, and Jared Goff. The Colts were in the bottom ten in passing yards and points per game last season, and the addition of rookie WR Josh Downs is excellent but won’t solve the entire problem. Jonathan Taylor will be a primary source of the offense, and Michael Pittman will be solid, but I don’t believe there will be enough week-to-week consistency in the passing game to trust starting him in single QB leagues. Superflex leagues have more flexibility, and the upside may outweigh the risk, so I can empathize with wanting some upside in the later rounds of the draft.g some upside in the later rounds of the draft.</p>
