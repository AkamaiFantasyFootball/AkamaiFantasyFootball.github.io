					<p>As I make my projections, there are always unique discrepancies between the consensus rankings and my own. Sometimes, they can be negligible, and others are vast. This year, I found eight players whom I have a larger discrepancy on where they should be ranked (Half PPR). Three will be players I have ranked higher than consensus and three will be lower. </p>
					
					<h5>Underrated</h5>

					<h5>Jakobi Meyers - LV (8)</h5>
					<p>After a red-hot start to last season, an LCL injury ended his season. With a full offseason to heal, I can understand the excitement and anticipation considering he averaged nearly ten targets a game and surpassed 100 receiving yards twice during those three games. However, I doubt he will continue to have the same target share as Xavier Worthy takes another step, and Hollywood Brown missed those three games. I still believe he's the top receiving threat within the offense as Travis Kelce is likely to take a step back. Still, the upside isn't as high as we believe, and I wouldn't be surprised if he finished outside of the top 24 WRs. I prefer players like Zay Flowers, Jameson Williams, and Tetairoa McMillan who have a lower ceiling but are not facing a potential suspension that could be in the range of four to six games. </p>

					
					<h5>Jauan Jennings - SF (14)</h5>
					<p> Coming off a breakout season where he led the team in targets with Brandon Aiyuk missing more than half of the season. During that time, Jennings averaged eight targets and surpassed 50 receiving yards in seven of those nine games. Deebo Samuel's departure and Aiyuk's expected absence at the start of the season create an opportunity for Jennings to emerge as a strong flex option, even if Ricky Pearsall takes another step in the offense. Depending on when Aiyuk returns, he may be a top 30 WR in the first half of the season and drafted after names such as Cooper Kupp and Khalil Shakir, people are underestimating his upside if he can maintain that target share. He won't have the same upside once Aiyuk is healthy, but he can still be a flex option in PPR scoring leagues. </p>
				

					<h5>Jaylen Waddle - MIA (12)</h5>
					<p> This one hurts. I was hyping up Waddle last year, and he had his worst season with career lows in targets, catches, yards, and touchdowns. The injury to Tua Tagovailoa didn't help, but failing to surpass 50 yards in ten games and four catches in 12 highlighted the floor for Waddle's role within the offense. The team brought in Darren Waller to replace Jonnu Smith, who was second on the team in targets. I doubt Waller will match that production, but he will still compete for targets. I also don't expect Waddle to remain a top 20 WR, and he is no longer a 1,000-yard receiver. However, drafted outside of the top 30 after names like Travis Hunter and Jerry Jeudy, Waddle's upside is great for a WR3 option who will end up with some WR2 performances.  </p>


					<h5>Overrated</h5>


					<h5>Rashee Rice - KC (10)</h5>
					<p>After a red-hot start to last season, an LCL injury ended his season. With a full offseason to heal, I can understand the excitement and anticipation considering he averaged nearly ten targets a game and surpassed 100 receiving yards twice during those three games. However, I doubt he will continue to have the same target share as Xavier Worthy takes another step, and Hollywood Brown missed those three games. I still believe he's the top receiving threat within the offense as Travis Kelce is likely to take a step back. Still, the upside isn't as high as we believe, and I wouldn't be surprised if he finished outside of the top 24 WRs. I prefer players like Zay Flowers, Jameson Williams, and Tetairoa McMillan who have a lower ceiling but are not facing a potential suspension that could be in the range of four to six games. </p>

					<h5>Chris Godwin - TB (9)</h5>
					<p>Missing more than half of last season, it is not encouraging to hear that he may end up missing regular-season games. The team drafted Emeka Egbuka in the first round to compete for targets with Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan, who showed some flashes in the second half of last season. Godwin will be the second option within the offense, my concern is that the increase in competition lowers his upside every week. He hasn't surpassed five touchdowns in his last four seasons, and the reduced target share doesn't help. Add to the potential of a slow start to the season, his ADP of a top 30 WR is too high, considering players like Jordan Addison and Rome Odunze are available. If Godwin can start the season healthy, I wouldn't mind drafting him, but until then, I can find another option.</p>


					<h5>Deebo Samuel - WAS (12)</h5>
					<p> Last season was rough, one of his worst seasons despite playing 15 games. With his lowest totals in rushing & receiving yards along with receptions and rushing touchdowns in four seasons, it's fair to wonder if he's no longer the dual threat he used to be. Joining Terry McLaurin and Jayden Daniels, he has the opportunity to be the second receiving threat on a team that threw for less than 4,000 yards last season. With Brian Robinson and Austin Ekeler, I don't know how many rushing opportunities he will have, and his ability as a rusher is what propels him into WR3 category. However, with names like Jakobi Meyers and Stefon Diggs still available, I would prefer to target someone with a higher floor as Samuel failed to reach 30 receiving yards in six of his last eight games. </p>
