					<p>Sometimes there are players that the consensus is high on, but you're just sitting here wondering what you're missing out on.  It's not that you don't like the player; it's just the perceived value is not worth the risk. Whether it'd be the role within the offense or health/injuries concerns, there are many variables that we subjectively value more than others when determining "busts." So instead of saying these players will outright fail, I'm never going to have them on my teams this season at their current ADP.</p>
					

					<h5>D.K. Metcalf (WR) - SEA (11)</h5>
					<p>Oh man, I can see this blowing up in my face. He finishes within the top 24 off of exploiting bad defenses and overcoming double teams against good ones. That realm of possibility remains as I write this. My issue is the ADP I've seen in several mock/live drafts. He has an uncomfortably high chance to be a bust if you draft him in the late 4th round expecting top 20 WR weekly performances. If not, you probably paid half a round early for his upside as the first receiving option on the team. </p>

					<p>Now, will a slight overpay cause you to lose your draft? Of course not! Having that elite upside is worth paying a higher ADP. However, looking at early WRs within the first few rounds, I prefer a safer secondary option on a better offense than a #1 WR on a run-heavy offense with a questionable QB. The guys who fall into this role are Jerry Jeudy, Marquise Brown, Allen Robinson, and Jaylen Waddle. Drafting these guys around one round after, where you may have to draft Metcalf seems too high of a price. Remember, he finished with 12 touchdowns last season. I think nine is his ceiling with this QB situation and could range as low as six. However, if he's still there in the mid-late 5th round (after those four names I mentioned earlier), I can't get too upset if you went RB heavy with a top 12 WR like Keenan Allen and wanted to swing for the fences.</p>
					
					<h5>James Cook (RB) - BUF (7)</h5>
					<p>Drafted around the 9th round in PPR formats, I think there are safer options available without risking upside. Sure the Bills' offense has 100+ vacated targets with Cole Beasley and Emmanuel Sanders gone, and the team moved on from Zack Moss in the offseason. These moves allow the rookie to have a week-to-week role within the offense. Devin Singletary is still the lead back within the offense, and I don't think we'll see a 60/40 split early in the season between these two. You may also forget that in the 9th round, guys like Melvin Gordon, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Nyheim Hines/J.D. Mckissic are there. Handcuffs like Alexander Mattison and Rachaad White are still available. For that reason, James Cook will likely be a bust because you're drafting him at the ceiling on an offense where the QB can scramble and run for the first down. Historically, QBs of that skill set don't tend to target the RB position as less mobile guys heavily do. If he's the last RB on your roster or in the 11th round, that's decent value. </p>
				
					<h5>Travis Etienne Jr. (RB) - JAX (11)</h5>
					<p>I wonder about his early 4th round ADP in standard scoring leagues and think that people are overestimating the efficiency of the Jacksonville rushing offense. Even with the added WRs to open up the passing game for Trevor Lawrence, the offensive line hasn't significantly improved to the point where they're going to be the Browns (Brandon Scherff). I think James Robinson will get involved when healthy, which may be after a couple of games, considering he's not on the PUP list. In full PPR, there are enough targets to provide a weekly top 30 RB floor that is gone in standard leagues.  </p>

					<p>I also don't think they'll score a ton of rushing touchdowns punching it into the goal line either, so he's a lower-tiered version of a player like D'andre Swift, who will need to compete with touches with James Robinson once he's healthy. So if you can get him in the 5th with guys like J.K. Dobbins, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, or A.J. Dillon, I'm more okay with it (I would prefer Dillon & CEH personally), and the early 6th round is where I would consider it a value pick as a flex option.</p>
					
					<h5>Trey Lance (QB) - SF (9)</h5>
					<p>This is for 6-point passing TD scoring leagues, as his rushing ability makes him worthy of his 9th round ADP in standard scoring leagues. My biggest concern is the opportunity cost you're passing up in a single QB league, drafting him before guys who aren't going to run but can throw for 4,000+ yds and 30 TDs (Matthew Stafford, Aaron Rodgers, Kirk Cousins). I understand if you're looking for the league-winning upside, but is it worth the volatility of a rushing QB on a run-heavy offense? I suppose we can thank Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts last season for that. To me, Trey Lance hasn't proved himself capable of being a week-to-week starter, so by drafting him too early, you may open yourself up to using a bench spot to roster a stable QB.</p>

					<p>However, if he's within the double-digit rounds or you have a large enough bench to roster a Kirk Cousins or Derek Carr, that gives him a higher margin of error, making his upside worth the risk. A similar player is Justin Fields. While he has fewer weapons around him, he has more game experience so that we can project a range of outcomes in becoming fantasy relevant compared to the three games we saw last season from Lance. The resigning of Jimmy Garoppolo as a backup doesn't change the big picture for Lance as the starter. If he loses his job to Garoppolo, he probably wasn't that effective in a fantasy football lens.</p>
