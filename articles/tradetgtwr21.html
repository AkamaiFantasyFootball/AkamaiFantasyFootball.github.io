				<div class="blog_content_wrap">
					<p>After a handful of games into the season, many of us are dealing with injuries, bad beats, and inconsistent players who have cost us a win or two. We may be looking to upgrade a specific position or add a little depth. Sometimes, we try to buy wins or invest in an injured player to reap the rewards later in the season. We all have our reasons for trading and what we value the most in our rosters. It's very subjective when rating trades, but I believe that there's a grey area where someone may not agree with your trade but can acknowledge that it's worth considering. As someone who doesn't trade often, I know a good trade when my first reaction to it is not an immediate yes or no, and I pause to map it out in my brain mentally. It would be best if you had a reason for offering a trade, but you also have to give up something of value as well. It's a delicate balance, but if done right, both teams can win.  </p>
					<p>These are three WRs that I either roster or have interest in trading for/away, depending on the team's situation. These guys, in particular, were initially projected to be top 12 WRs and are currently outside of the top 30. I discuss what the initial expectations were, how it's turning out, the best I can see happening, and what type of player I would like to get or give in return for one of these guys. </p>

					<h5><b>Allen Robinson</b> (CHI - WK 10)</h5>

					<p>The narrative around him has been an elite WR who has never had an above-average QB throughout his career. To prove it, he has back-to-back seasons of 1,100 yards and six touchdowns on nearly 100 catches playing with Mitch Trubisky and Nick Foles. He was entering this season with an upgrade at the QB position with Andy Dalton and drafting Justin Fields. However, over the past three games with Justin Fields as the starter, he has failed to reach five catches, surpass 75 yards, or score a touchdown. He could not top 35 yards in two out of those three games and feels unstartable for the foreseeable future. </p>
					<p>It's hard to have a big piece from a small pie. How small, you ask? How about never throwing more than 20 passing attempts in all three games. In today's NFL, that's much lower than the 25-35 range you would typically expect from a balanced offense that establishes the run. If you take Robinson's targets compared to the total passing attempts, he has approximately a 24.5% target share within the offense which isn't too drastic from the past two seasons (24.7% in 2020 & 26.5% in 2019). However, for a player who relied on volume (150+ targets in 2019 & 2020), the difference fundamentally changes his value within fantasy football. </p>
					<p>So what's the upside here? To be honest, not much. With Fields limited to less than 25 passing attempts per game, it's hard to view Robinson as more than a boom or bust flex option. This outlook assumes that the chemistry between the two will improve, and Fields will eventually have games with more than one passing TD.  I wouldn't be expecting more than seven targets and a handful of catches at best. He's talented enough to be fantasy relevant on limited volume, but it severely lowers his floor without raising the ceiling. </p>
					<p>One thing to note is that the last four games of the year for CHI are against defenses in the bottom half of the league in net yards per pass attempt and two out of those four are also against the bottom half of the league in passing TDs allowed. The favorable playoff schedule may sweeten the pot for those teams that are 5-0 or 4-1 with no pressure to start Robinson in the short-term future. He could be a good streaming option against good matchups or have a few big games where he can win you a week. </p>
					<p>In conclusion, I'll say this is a buy-low opportunity, but it would be hard to find an owner that would sell at a fair value because they drafted him in the fourth/fifth round. However, if you could get him for someone like Julio Jones, Tee Higgins, or Kenny Golladay, that would be a range that I would consider either a Robinson manager or looking to add him on my bench as a potential lottery ticket. </p>
					

			

					<h5><b>Calvin Ridley</b> (ATL - WK 6)</h5>

					<p>Entering the season as the primary receiving option, projected to finish as a top-five WR, Ridley has been disappointing, finishing with under 75 yards and no touchdowns in two out of four games and scoring one TD after six weeks. He's outside of the top 30 WR and is on bye this week after missing the previous week. While he's been consistent with his targets and is the primary option, that role hasn't equated to much, and the offense struggled. He has been a high floor WR2 with some appeal in PPR formats, but is it time to accept the new reality of the ATL offense, or will it improve? </p>
					<p>Under new head coach Arthur Smith, the offense has been struggling compared to previous years, with Matt Ryan currently on pace to throw for the lowest yards per attempt in his career. However, Ridley's target share has remained the same from last year (over 25% in four games) compared to his 24% last season. The volume of targets has kept his fantasy value afloat despite the pitiful yards per catch at 9.4 (never been lower than 12.8 in his career). Besides Cordarrelle Patterson, no other player has caught more than one touchdown on the season, and Matt Ryan is somewhere in the middle in passing TDs amongst the league. </p>
					<p> Ridley is still a great WR and Matt Ryan's favorite target. Assuming he continues to have a 25% target share within the offense, we could be looking at a consistent double-digit scoring WR in PPR scoring formats which means he will have a few big games when scoring a TD. Some of the top-scoring WRs will eventually regress or have a few bad games throughout the season, and Ridley's consistency will become valuable. Perhaps the offense will improve over time, along with the first-year head coach learning on the job. I'm not anticipating a drastic change, but to be dead last in the league in average depth of target is concerning, and I don't think that was intentional.  </p>
					<p>Overall, I wouldn't be selling low on him by any means. However, the production is disappointing, and you will likely not get a top 10 WR in return. As someone who doesn't have Ridley in any roster at the beginning of the year, he's been someone that I'm targeting as a high-end WR2 in leagues where I have too many flex options. If I could acquire him for Adam Thielen, Tyler Lockett, or Amari Cooper, a player that may be too volatile on a week-to-week basis, that would be worth considering. If I could trade him for someone like Stefon Diggs, A.J. Brown, or Diontae Johnson, that would be hard for me to turn down since it's not likely going to be enough to trade in a one for one swap. </p>
			



					<h5><b>A.J. Brown</b> (TEN - WK 13)</h5>

					<p>He is coming off of back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons and double-digit touchdowns last season despite missing a couple of games. However, with the addition of Julio Jones, it was expected for his volume to go down as the primary receiving option on a run-heavy offense. The thing is, Julio hasn't been that great either and was out the past two games due to injury. Brown missed one game due to injury but was disappointing last week with three catches for 38 yards on six targets. He hasn't surpassed 50 yards in a single game and only has scored one TD this season. Ryan Tannehill has thrown six touchdowns in five games and has looked a bit worse than what we've been used to seeing in previous years.  </p>
					<p>Brown's 2020 game logs showed that he had three games with less than 50 yards and no touchdown compared to five games with at least 90 yards and a TD. Additionally, he had over 20% of the team's target share and is currently around 20% this season. Tannehill threw 22 passes last week, which explains Brown's six targets. This tells me that he's still the primary target but, for some reason, is not able to translate onto the field. He caught around 60% of his targets in his previous seasons, currently 40% after three games. One notable issue is that the offensive line has struggled to protect Tannehill, giving him the time to target Brown. On the other hand, the defense has looked vulnerable, so perhaps they will be forced to throw the ball more often. Ryan Tannehill has looked inconsistent after a few games, and Brown's catch rate reflects that. Perhaps 2020 was the upside, and 2021 is the natural regression that happens to many players after a great season.  </p>
					<p>We all know what the upside could be. At any point during a game, he can take a 10-yard slant pass and run it for 50 yards to score a TD. It's also possible that he could finish the game with less than 50 yards. That's the boom-or-bust nature that will happen on a run-heavy offense that may throw the ball 25 times in a game. Last year, he started the first three weeks with a bust performance and struggled with injuries to finish with 11 touchdowns in 13 games. He's someone who can change the momentum of a game with a big play of him just outrunning/running over defenders in the open field. Even if Julio occasionally steals the spotlight, Brown should remain the top receiving weapon on the offense. </p>
					<p>I have him in only one league where I have plenty of depth at the WR position, so his inconsistency hasn't ruined my early season start. However, if you're in a tough situation, I understand selling him a little lower than you would like for a player that's more consistent such as Calvin Ridley, Robert Woods, or even Michael Pittman. But, on the other hand, if you can get a player with more upside, such as Keenan Allen, Stefon Diggs, or Chris Godwin, that would be easier to part with the eventual boom weeks, knowing you have more stability from your WR1. So, if you can handle the volatility, I would try to acquire him without giving up WR1 value or hold, but I don't expect many owners to sell low on him just yet. </p>
