					<p>As I make my projections, there are always unique discrepancies between the consensus rankings and my own. Sometimes, they can be negligible, and others are vast. This year, I found eight players whom I have a larger discrepancy on where they should be ranked (Half PPR). Four will be players I have ranked higher than consensus and four will be lower. </p>
					
					<h5>Underrated</h5>

					<h5>Davante Adams - LV (13)</h5>
					<p>With at least nine targets in all but four games this season, he was the primary receiving threat on the offense. The team added Jakobi Meyers but lost Darren Waller, and they now have Jimmy Garoppolo as the starting QB. The questions of whether he will maintain the same volume of targets, along with how the offense will change with the roster moves, are valid. However, he surpassed 100 catches in four of the past five seasons, surpassing 1,300 receiving yards and double-digit touchdowns. Whatever the offense looks like, he’s going to finish as a top-five WR with the upside to finish within the top three. He’s being drafted after players like Stefon Diggs, A.J. Brown, and Ceedee Lamb. While those players could finish in the top five, none surpassed 11 touchdowns in their career. Adams had 14 last season and 18 in 2020, which gives him a slight edge over those names despite the questions about the offense and his age.</p>

					
					<h5>Keenan Allen - LAC (5)</h5>
					<p> Despite missing most of the first half of last season due to injury, he was able to finish off strong, surpassing 80 receiving yards in six out of eight games, averaging more than seven receptions per game. The team brought in a new offensive coordinator (Kellen Moore) and drafted rookie WR Quentin Johnson to add a receiving threat for Justin Herbert. Even if Johnson removes some of the volume from Allen, I don’t think it’ll be drastic enough for him to fall outside the top 20 WRs. I still consider Allen an upper-tier WR2 with WR1 upside if he can score eight touchdowns instead of six. He’s drafted around D.J. Moore, Calvin Ridley, and D.K. Metcalf. Still, I would prefer Allen over all those names in PPR scoring leagues due to the quality of the offense (top three in passing yards & attempts) and the perceived higher floor on a week-by-week basis. Before his injury last season, he played 16 games in four of the previous five seasons, so I’m not ready to say he’s “injury-prone.” </p>
				

					<h5>Amari Cooper - CLE (5)</h5>
					<p> Despite finishing in the top ten with Jacoby Brissett and a rusty Deshaun Watson, he’s currently being drafted outside of the top 15 after players like Tee Higgins, Chris Olave, and Devonta Smith. I understand the concern if you don’t believe Deshaun Watson can return to what he was in Houston, but I don’t think it’s fair to expect him not to improve a little. With an entire off-season, Watson should be better than last season, and the efficiency should improve for Cooper than what we saw. Don’t forget that Cooper finished with a career-high in touchdowns and targets last season. Adding Elijah Moore should help improve the offense, even if Cooper loses some targets. Sure, he may not reach the top ten again, but I still consider him a top 15 WR as the clear WR1 on a roster with a potential top 10 QB. I wouldn’t be rushing to draft him in the 3rd round, but I’ve seen him fall to the 4th and would be happy drafting him as my WR2 or WR1 with my WR2 in the next round. </p>

					<h5>Tyler Lockett - SEA (5)</h5>
					<p> After finishing nine games with at least five catches and 60 yards with four games over 90 yards, Lockett has continued to be an impressive WR2 with WR1 upside. Geno Smith proved that he can support two top-24 WRs. Over the past four seasons, he averaged 80 catches, 1,000 yards, and at least eight touchdowns. Last season, he finished as a top 15 WR in half PPR and can be seen outside of the top 30 in some drafts. The team added rookie RB Zach Charbonnet, but I’m convinced the offense will remain pass-friendly. I believe he’s a potential top-24 WR, even if rookie WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba ends up taking away some targets. Lockett’s big-play ability would be capable of being a weekly flex option with that WR1 upside on the weeks he scores a touchdown on a big play. He’s been an easy WR3 to draft in the middle rounds that I would prefer over some other names, such as Mike Williams, Brandon Aiyuk, or Diontae Johnson.  </p>


					<h5>Overrated</h5>


					<h5>Calvin Ridley - JAX (9)</h5>
					<p>His last game was Week 7 in 2021, where he averaged six catches and over 50 yards in five games. On an entirely new offense, he is projected to be the primary receiving threat on an offense that finished in the top ten in passing yards. He’s currently being drafted in the top 20 and sometimes even in the top 15. While I think he’ll have some games where he can finish in the top 12, I don’t think that’ll be the majority. Christian Kirk will have some games as the WR1 and Zay Jones will still be involved every week. Evan Engram and Travis Etienne are still involved as well. This isn’t the ATL offense in 2020, where Russell Gage was second on the team in targets because Julio Jones only played nine games. I have him as my WR25, which means he’s not a bust, but I think the week-to-week shifts in production are not worth drafting him in the first three or four rounds over names like Keenan Allen and Terry Mclaurin. </p>

					<h5>D.J. Moore - CHI (13)</h5>
					<p>While I think he’s incredibly talented, I’m not too excited about the offense he’s on. I think he will face some of the same struggles he’s had throughout his career, despite it being for reasons beyond his control. He’s on projected run-heavy offense, where Justin Fields had 15 or more completions in five games last season. Fields also surpassed 200 yards in two games. While Moore may be a big part of the offense, I don’t see how people are drafting him within the top 24 when names such as Terry McLaurin, Drake London, and Brandon Aiyuk are available. I can understand drafting him if you’re for a boom-or-bust WR3 with upside. I believe he will have a handful of games within the top 20,  but are you okay when he falls out of the top 40 when he doesn’t score that game and finishes with three catches for 40 yards? Drafting him with the expectation of a weekly starter is going to be tough to navigate when he has a couple of bad games where he’s not producing top-24 numbers without the big play for a touchdown.</p>

					<h5>Christian Watson - GB (6)</h5>
					<p>The change in QB from Aaron Rodgers to Jordan Love is the root of why I’m not confident in “copying and pasting” his role from last year and applying the same numbers to project this season. We have no idea what the offense will look like, and we don’t know if Love will be able to consistently give an opportunity for Watson to make a big play or if he will get overthrown again. Last season, he got hot in the second half, scoring seven touchdowns in four straight games before finishing the last four games averaging four catches for 52 yards. We’ll see more games like that than the 100-yard performances last year. He’s being drafted within the top 24 or right outside of it, and I don’t have him within my top 36. I don’t have the immediate confidence in Jordan Love to be able to jump in as the starter and put up numbers similar to Rodgers last year. I also don’t believe the target rate will be the same, and for Watson, that gives me bust signals when he’s drafted anywhere within the top 30.</p>

					<h5>Elijah Moore - CLE (5) </h5>
					<p>When you get into the lower half of the WR rankings, it’s hard to find significant discrepancies, and generally, you can understand how people may perceive a player. I don’t believe he will come into a role with a large enough volume to finish anywhere near the top 40. I still think Donovan Peoples-Jones will be involved, while David Njoku will also have a few big games as well. Sure, if Deshaun Watson improves, then that improves the total volume and efficiency of the offense. However, I think it’ll primarily help the focal points of the offense more than a complementary piece. Moore is drafted around names like Michael Thomas, Quentin Johnson, and Rashod Bateman/Zay Flowers. I prefer to take a shot on any of those players over Moore. This is still a run-centered offense around Nick Chubb, and Watson will also scramble a bit. This feels like a bust, but it doesn’t feel as cool when it’s a WR outside the top 36.</p>
