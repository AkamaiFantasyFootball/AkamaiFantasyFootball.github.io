						This past season was a lot of fun, and by "fun" I mean drowning in anxiety and misery. Because I hate having "fun," I wanted to get a deeper understanding of a few statistical trends over the past few seasons and how it affects certain positions as a whole. By collecting data from 2015 up until this past season, I gathered a sample size large enough to prevent any outliers from skewing the results. But first, a little reminder for myself whenever I'm having too much "fun."
					</p>

					<h5>1.	Know what kind of player you are and how you like to construct your teams. </h5>
					<p>Everyone wants to win, but moving on from a loss separates good teams from being lucky. It's essential to enjoy and adjust to the ups and downs, attacking the waivers each week with renewed enthusiasm. I can lose a week knowing the thought process behind my decisions, and at the time, I felt it was the best team possible.</p>
					<p>So what’s the “best team possible”? Simply put, it is the team that you, yourself, believed gave you the highest chance to win. Sometimes, you decide to start Will Fuller over Jamison Crowder because you wanted a player with a higher touchdown upside.  Or you are flexing James White over Mecole Hardman because you can't afford to have a doughnut (0) while fighting for a playoff spot. Understanding roster construction and your team's style are critical variables to composing the best team every week. Your "best team" will change depending on last week's outcomes and next week's projections.</p>



					<h5>2.	Are quarterbacks more valuable in 2020? </h5>
					<p>Reflecting on the ascension of Lamar Jackson and Pat Mahomes along with the recent rule changes that protect quarterbacks, are they producing more fantasy points now than over the past few years? I wanted to see if the top ten QBs average more points per game in 2019 than previous seasons. I excluded any QBs that played less than seven games and went back to 2015 to notice any current trends.</p>
					<p>The average score for a top 10 QB in 2019 with standard scoring settings was 21.64 points, which is the highest since 2015 and is two full points higher than the lowest output in 2017. Every other year fell somewhere between the two by a half a point (2018) on either side (2016).  However, what inflated last season's average was Lamar Jackson's monster year in which he averaged 28 points per game. That’s higher than Pat Mahomes legendary season in 2018 (26.6), and Deshaun Watson in 2017 (24.1). If you excluded Lamar Jackson and Pat Mahomes last year, the next two quarterbacks averaged the same points per game as the number two and three quarterbacks every other year. Simply put, the top 3 quarterbacks are producing similar numbers except for the record-breaking seasons that we never saw coming.</p>

					<p>What separates the past two seasons is how much deeper the quarterback position has been. In 2019, eight quarterbacks averaged more than 20 points per game, which is lower than the year before with nine quarterbacks achieving the same feat. No other year has more than six with one year having only three (2017).  The difference isn't that huge, though. Two-thirds of those quarterbacks average more than 18.5 points with nearly half averaging 19.</p>
					<p>Sure, a point is a point, but is it a big enough difference to change the late-round QB narrative? This is especially true when the early drafted quarterbacks usually fail to meet expectations a la Pat Mahomes this past season and Carson Wentz after his MVP caliber 2017 season. I'll wait until the later rounds to draft a QB due to the position's depth, especially this season. </p>

					<h5>3.	Are targets king for projecting wide receivers? </h5>
					<p>It makes sense, but how often do the top 24 wide receivers in targets finish a WR2 in production? I organized the receivers by targets starting from 2015 and compared it to their fantasy finish at the end of the year.</p>
					<p>Imagine if you saw a restaurant that 82% of their ratings on yelp were four to five stars, would you consider trying that place? If yes, then that place is called Targets because around 82% of the top 24 wide receivers in targets ended up finishing as a WR2 in half-point PPR. Two wide receivers were disappointed last year, and they were Odell Beckham Jr. and Jamison Crowder. Crowder and his 122 targets (17th) ended up as WR33 in half-point PPR, and Odell with his 133 targets (13th) ended up as WR31. Another player who qualified was Deandre Hopkins in 2016 (WR39) when Brock Osweiler was his quarterback. We all can assume why that didn’t work out.</p>
					<p>What about those elite wide receivers? Do the top 12 in targets equal to the top 12 in production? Surprisingly, only about 70% of receivers end up producing WR 1 value with those opportunities and 21% finish with WR 2 value. Notice how that doesn't equal 100%, which means some players may not finish as a top 24 WR despite that volume.</p>
					<p>When analyzing receivers who were ranked 13-24 in targets, 75% finished with WR2 production, but over ⅓ of those ended with WR1 production. Players like Amari Cooper, Devante Parker, and Chris Godwin outproduced others with similar target numbers last year, like Tyler Boyd, Jarvis Landry, and Robert Woods. So while targets don't guarantee production, they are still a good indicator and should be considered when projecting a receiver's future. </p>


					<h5>4.	Can I predict a first-round RB bust?</h5>
					<p>One of the most frustrating things about the draft that gives me nightmares is the dreaded running back bust in the first round. I've been a victim with James Connor this past year and David Johnson the year before. I wanted to determine if there are variables that can help me identify what makes an RB1 and how much that criteria changes for an RB2. </p>
					<p>The variables I chose were: the percentage of the team’s rushing attempts and whether they were top 24 in RB targets. I decided targets because players like Derrick Henry and James White, who are on opposite ends of the spectrum yet are still productive for their teams. I also chose the percentage of team touches because I wanted to account for rushing QBs and RB committees to view how they affect running back production. </p>
					<p>Since 2015, over 78% of RB1 finished with at least the top 24 targets in their respective year. Exceptions to this rule are guys like Derrick Henry, Zeke (pre-2018), and Adrian Peterson (2015). Virtually guys who are on teams that emphasize the run and get the goal line carries while being the workhorse (average more than 60% of the team rushing attempts)</p>
					<p>More than 50% of RB1 account for more than 60% of their team's total rushing attempts.  25% of the remaining RB1 accounts for more than 50% of their team's total rushing attempts. Besides the occasional James White, Austin Ekeler, or Alvin Kamara, you need volume to produce, whether touches or targets.</p>


					<p>The variables for RB2s were more forgiving as around 40% were not in the top 24 for targets, and 43% did not get more than 50% of the team's total rushing attempts. Guys like Alex Collins, Tevin Coleman (on the Falcons), and Latavius Murray (on the Vikings) consistently fell into both categories. Marlon Mack was the only RB in 2019 to achieve this; however, he missed a few games, which skewed his touches in relation to the team's touches.  </p>
					<p>When drafting an RB in the first round, they need to have a clear path to receive the lion's share of touches, while also having a consistent role in the passing game. Injury history or the team's offensive line can be used as tie-breakers when comparing the elite few. Hopefully, by digging a little deeper than the box score, I can at least lie to myself and say that I'll avoid drafting a bust in the first round again next year.</p>
