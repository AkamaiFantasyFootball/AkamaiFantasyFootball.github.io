					<h2>Sleepers 2022</h2>

					<p>The term "sleeper" refers to overlooked and undervalued players within the public's opinion. Last season, I reserved this word for undrafted players who have an opportunity to become weekly starters at some of this season. Last season I mentioned Kirk Cousins and Tyler Boyd, who were fantasy-relevant, and Courtland Sutton (first few games, though) and Tyler Higbee, who wasn't as successful. This season, I seem to like secondary RBs with handcuff value and a couple of double-digit round WRs with top 30 upside.</p>
					<h5>Michael Gallup (WR) - DAL (9)</h5> 
					<p>I would like to add an exciting name as my WR4/5 within the double-digit rounds (ADP is within the 14th/15th round). Ranked outside the top 50 by some, many have forgotten him as the #2 WR on an above-average offense with many vacant targets (165 between Amari Cooper & Cedrick Wilson). I understand that Gallup will likely miss games at the beginning of the season and is capable of going on the PUP (however, he isn't despite the team being able to). Assuming he does miss a couple of games, he has the potential to finish a top 36 WR playing 13-14 games. The fact that he's available at the end of your draft makes this player a perfect definition of a sleeper.</p>

					<p>Averaging nearly seven targets a game last season when healthy, I feel confident we can see similar target volume despite Ceedee Lamb and Dalton Schultz absorbing additional targets. He finished with over 100 targets in 2019 (1,000 yd season behind Amari Cooper and Randall Cobb was three) and 2020 (behind Cooper and Ceedee Lamb), so he's capable of taking on a prominent role within the offense. Rookie Jalen Tolbert will contribute along with more opportunities for RB Tony Pollard. However, I don't see both of them taking over 100+ targets or even close to that. He's someone I'm targeting in every standard-scoring league, and I will not hesitate to add him as my last WR in PPR formats.

					<h5>Rachaad White (RB) - TB (11)</h5>
					<p>While I don't expect him to compete for a significant role within the committee for carries, I believe he will have PPR value as a receiving back early in the season. With Russell Gage and Chris Godwin's status for Week 1 in the air, we could also see more opportunities for White with Leonard Fournette on the field in limited snaps. However, I think White is in the handcuff territory, as I don't predict Keyshawn Vaughn having a notable weekly role within the offense with everyone healthy. If Fournette were to miss a game, White would be the lead back, sharing passing downs with Vaughn.

					<<p> At an ADP within the double-digit rounds (13th/14th), he's a good candidate to add to the end of your bench. However, I won't hesitate to drop him after a few weeks if his role in the passing game is minimal or if it's a three-headed committee at RB, which would remove any interest in White in any scoring format. A player comparison (not in talent, but the role within their offense) is Tony Pollard, who has shown himself to be a weekly contributor behind Ezekiel Elliot last season (within the top 30 RB). </p>
					
					<h5>Robert Woods (WR) - TEN (6)</h5>
					<p>While he's not as low on the ADP list, getting drafted around the 10th/11th round is not a bad price for a guy who's shown capable of being a top 24 WR when healthy. Coming off a torn ACL last season and joining one of the run-heaviest offenses, it's clear why he's no longer a top 30 WR in many opinions. Remember last season in nine games, he had six or more targets in seven games and had four games with at least five catches and 60 yards, along with four touchdowns. He also finished with 90 catches, 936 yds, and 6 TD the season before. When healthy, he has WR2 upside and can finish within the top 36 in PPR scoring formats. The team drafted Treylon Burks to help mitigate the loss of A.J. Brown however is still a rookie and cannot be expected to handle the #1 WR duties on that offense. That's where Robert Woods comes in.</p>
					<p>Over the past two seasons, Ryan Tannehill has thrown the ball 1,012 times. Averaging, it comes out to 506 passing attempts, and with the loss of A.J. Brown, let's expect the team to win fewer games (passing more) with worse efficiency. With that said, I expect similar passing volume this season and the 153 combined vacated targets (105 - Brown in 13 games & 48 - Julio in 10 games) give Woods a safe floor of at least 100 targets with the potential for 120 depending on how the offense spreads the ball around. The team doesn't have a legitimate receiving threat besides Burks and Woods; therefore, I feel confident drafting Woods as my WR4 in PPR scoring formats. Standard leagues, I may wait a bit since I'm not projecting eight touchdowns or 1,000 yards, and he loses the upside that makes him an exciting pick to begin with. </p>


					<h5>Jamaal Williams (RB) - DET (6)</h5>

					<p>Drafted in the last few rounds (15th or later); I feel like he isn't getting the same recognition as one of the top handcuffs with some standalone value like Alexander Mattison or Michael Carter (both guys drafted in the 12th round). Despite averaging double-digit carries as the second RB behind Swift last season, he has proven to be a capable desperation flex option in good matchups. When it comes to sleepers, many people look for players with an extremely high ceiling, but I think guys with safe floors are underrated. Williams is a capable receiver out of the backfield, and if Swift were to miss time (missed 3/4 games in his early career), Williams could temporarily fill that role. </p>

					<p>When Swift was injured last season, Williams averaged 18 carries in two games splitting time with Craig Reynolds. I'm anticipating that the offense will improve from last season, which should help open up running lanes and provide more scoring opportunities for Swift and Williams. Williams may not have the upside of other handcuffs since he will be in some committee even with Swift hurt; however, his week-to-week role within the offense provides a floor that many players lack. </p>
