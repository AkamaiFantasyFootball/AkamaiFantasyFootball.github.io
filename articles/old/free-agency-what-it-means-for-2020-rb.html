					<p>Unless you're in a dynasty league, fantasy football currently doesn't occupy your mind during May. Let alone during a worldwide pandemic that is spreading across the world, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and economic turmoil. I hope this will provide insight and entertainment on a whirlwind of free agency and the NFL draft with all that's been happening. Like stars in constellations, I will connect various statistics with what teams did in the off-season to create narratives on how these newly acquired players will help their teams and their fantasy impact.</p>
					<p><b>Running Back:</b> If you want to make the most money in the NFL, don't be a running back. If you exclude Leveon Bell (4 years, $52.5 million), Melvin Gordon is the next highest average paid player (2 years, $16 million) in the past two seasons. While this is attributed to the declining value of the position, it also has been a relatively quieter free agency period than last season. This will be a short list, but there are still a couple of names that will make an impact this upcoming season and more still waiting for their chance.</p>

					<p>Please note that this will only include fantasy relevant (RB2/Flex) players. Sorry to handcuffs like Dion Lewis (NYG) and Ameer Abdullah (MIN).</p>

					<h5>Melvin Gordon - DEN - 2 years, $16 million, $13.5 fully guaranteed.</h5>
					<p>This one was incredibly disappointing. Excluding last season, I've been a Melvin Gordon owner since 2016. I believe he's a talented workhorse back that has shown the ability to do it all. Excluding his rookie year, he's averaged 45 receptions, nearly 1,300 total scrimmage yards, and double-digit touchdowns while usually playing 12-13 games. He can play a full season (2017), but it would be irresponsible to dismiss the injury concerns throughout the season. </p>
					<p>So why is this disappointing? Heading to a division rival, with current starter Philip Lindsay on his last year before becoming a restricted free agent, it would seem that the team invested in making the Gordon the starter. Plus, the signing of former Lions interior OL Graham Glasgow and drafting center Lloyd Cushenberry will help open up running lanes for him. The problem is with the injury concerns, new team, and projected volume, there may be too much uncertainty to draft him without overpaying. If it's a 60-40 split between Gordon and Lindsay, then how excited are we? It could be worse, and we won't know until Week 1, and that concerns me.</p>
					<p>In 2019, the Broncos were a bottom-five scoring offense averaging 17.6 points per game while the Chargers never averaged less than 21 since 2016. With aging veteran Joe Flacco and rookie Drew Locke, the team leaned on the running game to be the offense's focal point (sixth lowest in total passing attempts). However, with the team drafting receivers Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler in the first two rounds, they're showing their commitment to providing a more balanced offense. While their off-season gives me optimism that things will improve, I will not be comfortable drafting Gordon in the first three rounds.</p>

					<h5>Jordan Howard - MIA - 2 years, $9.75 million, $4.75 fully guaranteed.</h5>
					<p>Strange as it sounds, this gives me the hope of an undervalued RB2 option in standard-scoring leagues. At 25 years old, coming off an injured 2019 where he missed eight games, he averaged 66 yards and almost a touchdown when he received double-digit carries. Before that, he was practically a 1000 yard rusher every year since entering the league. With the team not drafting a running back, Howard could be in line for 15-18 touches a game with all the goal line opportunities. They also traded for Matt Breida, but I believe Howard will still produce even with Breida entering on passing downs.</p>
					<p>Let's talk about the elephant or rather dolphin in the room. The Miami Dolphins were not a good team. Because they're not a good team, the game script forced them to throw more since they were trailing in most games. This led to the lowest total rushing attempts in 2019, and the quarterback was the team's leading rusher. We expect the team to perform better in the run with the team drafting tackle Austin Jackson and guard Robert Hunt in the first two rounds and signing center Ted Karras. Add in the significant defensive acquisitions in free agency (Byron Jones, Shaq Lawson, Kyle Van Noy), and we may be looking at a much more competitive team. </p>



					<h5>Todd Gurley - ATL - 1 year, $6 million, and $5 million from the LA Rams in 2020.</h5>
					<p>After all the off-season speculation on what Gurley's workload will be in 2019, he still finished with more than 220 rushes, 850 yards, and 12 touchdowns while playing 15 games, despite an injury-depleted offensive line that resembles a revolving door of unproven backups. While the touchdowns will regress, he proved that he is still capable of being a productive running back when given the opportunity. Now with no Devonta Freeman, Gurley is in position to be the lead back on the Falcons. With the team not drafting a running back, Gurley has an excellent chance to receive the lion's share of carries since we know what Brian Hill and Ito Smith are. While the injury concerns will only grow after every season, I'm willing to take a chance once again for the appropriate value.</p>
					<p>Call me crazy, but I can envision the top 15 value for Gurley in PPR leagues. With 59 receptions for Freeman last season and the Falcons generally being a pass-happy team (bottom five in rushing attempts), we hope that the Falcons will target Gurley in the backfield (59 receptions in 2018) and that could compensate for the rushing touchdown regression. The departure of Austin Hooper leaves 97 targets up for grabs, and Hayden Hurst is likely not repeating that. With all the narratives against him, if Gurley gets the passing volume as he did in 2017 & 2018 and 200+ touches (which he's done every year) top 15 production is undoubtedly obtainable and will be a value if he falls into the fourth round.</p>
