					<h2>Sleepers 2020</h2>

				<div class="blog_content_wrap">
					<p>The term “sleeper” refers to overlooked and undervalued players within the public’s opinion. However, as a fan, I see the label applied to mid-round players like Ronald Jones, Marvin Jones Jr, and Will Fuller. Perhaps this could be an appropriate term, but I want to take it to the next step. Sleepers are players that people are “sleeping” on, meaning they’re not going to the last few rounds of your draft, if at all. These guys’ true range of outcomes is not accurate and could result in one of Week 1 or 2 hottest waiver pickups. These four players are consistent targets in my draft that I believe have a likely chance to be a weekly start.</p>
					<h5>Boston Scott - PHI (9)</h5>
					<p><b>Disclaimer</b>, I’m a fan of getting a handcuff for your best RB if the designated handcuff role is obvious (i.e., Mattison, Hunt, Pollard). So if I ever draft Miles Sanders, I’m drafting Boston Scott in the double-digit rounds. If I don’t draft Miles Sanders, and Boston Scott is there in the 12th round, I’ll take him as my RB4/5. I believe Scott will be the handcuff that people realize after a couple of weeks will have some standalone value in any PPR format.</p>

					<p>During Weeks 14-17, he nearly averaged 15 touches a game (nine carries, six receptions) where he destroyed the Giants twice with over 120+ total yards 1+ TD each game. Sure, the Giants’ defense wasn’t elite, but his ADP (RB45-50) doesn’t reflect the upside. While his upside isn’t as high as a Hunt/Mattison due to his size, he should be a mid-tier RB2 as the committee’s lead if Sanders were to get injured. His competition includes Corey Clement, which doesn’t scare me, and he’s my favorite RB5 to grab in the last couple rounds of my draft.</p>

					<h5>Justin Jefferson - MIN (7)</h5>
					<p>He is currently going as WR45-50, drafted after the likes of Ceedee Lamb & Jerry Jeudy. It may only be a few spots between them, but I’m convinced that Jefferson will be the most consistent rookie WR this season. With the departure of Stefon Diggs, that opened up 94 targets, and while Olabisi Johnson and Irv Smith Jr. will get some targets, I believe Jefferson will be the one to impact those players. He may not be fantasy-relevant in standard-scoring leagues because of the team’s passing volume, as he won’t be a primary redzone target. </p>
					<p>I don’t have anything from his college production that gives me evidence of my belief in his ability because I don’t do much more research on rookies besides watching some game tape during the draft season. Sometimes you just have to go with your gut and take that leap of faith that gives us the chance to find that diamond in the rough. If he works out, I’ll remind everyone about this next year, and if not, won’t be mentioned again.</p>

					<h5>Preston Williams - MIA (11)</h5>
					<p>Coming off an ACL injury in Week 9, he averaged seven targets in 8 games in his rookie year. His injury helped Devante Parker skyrocket into WR1 territory. People forgot how he was generating camp buzz throughout the last offseason as well. He’s a big receiver at 6’5 and 200+ pounds competing for the second option in targets with TE Mike Gesicki. Don’t forget that two receivers for the team (Albert Wilson & Allen Hurns) opted out this year, so there are targets for grabs even if the overall volume decreases.</p>
					<p>The change in quarterback during the season is a fair concern, and I agree that it will hurt his production when rookie QB Tua Tagovailoa starts. I also believe that due to a lack of passing weapons on the team will force Tua to target him more than a couple of times. In any scoring setting, I’m taking Williams as my WR4, who could be a flex option in favorable matchups. </p>


					<h5>Jonnu Smith - TEN (7)</h5>
					<p>This opinion may be a little hypocritical after my criticism of mid-round players considered sleepers as he is a popular option as a late-round target for many people. But I don’t see him drafted a top 12 option, so my paper flimsy excuse to include him on this list. When he started in place of Delanie Walker, he showed flashes of big-play ability after the catch and was used as a runner to catch the defense by surprise.</p>
					<p>If I miss out on the top 4 TE and it’s the double-digit rounds, Smith will be on my list and another streaming option in the last round. What makes him more valuable to the other late-round options is the lack of competition for targets on a team despite averaging 26 passing attempts per game. Smith could be #2 in targets ahead of Corey Davis, Adam Humphries, and Kalif Raymond. That could end up as five targets, which would almost double his target total from last season (44). I have him with less than 80 targets but still making a sizeable jump at 70, making him a possible TE1 in any scoring format.</p>
