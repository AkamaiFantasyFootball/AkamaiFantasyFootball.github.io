					<h2>Free Agency 2020 - What it means - WR</h2>

					<p>Unless you're in a dynasty league, fantasy football currently doesn't occupy your mind during May. Let alone during a worldwide pandemic that is spreading across the world, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and economic turmoil. I hope this will provide insight and entertainment on a whirlwind of free agency with all that's been happening. Like stars in a constellation, I will connect various statistics with who teams drafted to create narratives on how they help their teams and what we can expect this upcoming season.</p>
					<p><b>Wide Receiver:</b> Besides Amari Cooper, this is not a big name free agency class compared to previous years. However, there are a few guys that I expect to be fantasy relevant. Now while most of these players won't be studs on your fantasy roster, they still can provide value with upside on the right match-ups and should be discussed. When projecting wide receivers, it's essential to acknowledge the quarterback situation and the team's general type of offense. While talent will win out most times (i.e., Kenny Golladay & Courtland Sutton), there are situations where the type of offense will limit a player's upside (i.e., A.J. Brown). </p>
					<p>Please note that this will only include receivers who, I believe, can provide weekly flex value in all scoring formats. Sorry to Devin Funchess (GB) and Randall Cobb (HOU).</p>

					<h5>Amari Cooper - DAL - 5 years, $100 million, $60 million fully guaranteed.</h5>
					<p>With four 1,000 yard seasons out of five seasons in the NFL, it's clear that he's one of the most talented route runners in this league. In his first full season with Dallas, he finished with career highs in yards(1189) and touchdowns (8). This included his second-half slump, which comprised of four games with no more than four catches and 38 yards in any of them. He is consistently inconsistent but a game-changer with Dak Prescott. With Michael Gallup being more of a 1B rather than a second option, Cobb's departure only solidifies the 120+ targets for Cooper even if Gallup repeats with another 113 target season. </p>
					<p>At least until the Cowboys drafted Ceedee Lamb in the first round, if you don't know who Ceedee Lamb is, he is a very talented receiver who will immediately impact the team. I don't believe he will supplant Cooper or Gallup, but I start to wonder about the upside for everyone involved. Only Matt Ryan, Jared Goff, and Phillip Rivers completed more passes than Dak in 2019, with the leader completing 20 more passes. There's no place but to go down for passing volume, limiting Cooper's ceiling and lowering the floor.</p>
					<p>Now is he a top twelve wide receiver? I think it's close, but I'm leaning towards yes. He is the first receiving option on a great offense (first in yards per game, sixth in points per game) while fighting through injuries. New head coach Mike McCarthy retained offensive coordinator Kellen Moore which is a good sign that schematically, things won't drastically change. While the retirement of All-Pro center Travis Frederick will hurt Dak, which in turn affects Cooper, I'm still drafting him before guys such as Cooper Kupp, Stefon Diggs, and D.J Moore. While he may be inconsistent, Cooper will finish as a WR1 if he stays healthy.</p>

					<h5>Robby Anderson - CAR - 2 years, $20 million, $12 million fully guaranteed.</h5>

					<p>I want to avoid drafting him until the double-digit rounds. That's the synopsis of how I feel. I'm aware that we have no clue what offensive scheme new head coach Matt Rhule plans to implement. With Teddy Bridgewater getting the opportunity to start, it's a bit concerning for Robby since Teddy is not known to throw the ball deep or be a volume passer. He's also not a clear top three receiving option in the offense. How does the presence of Curtis Samuel affect the snap share for him? With the team focusing on the defense in the draft, he will have an opportunity to impact the game; it's just not looking promising until it happens.</p>
					<p>Due to the unpredictability of his role within the offense, it could easily backfire on me. From Week 10, he finished with 29 receptions for 437 yards and four touchdowns. He was arguably the best receiver on the Jets, therefore, receiving more defensive attention than he will be getting in Carolina. With D.J. Moore and CMC being the featured weapons, the hope is that he will break open big plays while still being a secondary option. With these question marks, this feels like a boom or bust player that can win or lose you weeks. </p>

					<h5>Emmanuel Sanders - NO - 2 years, $16 million, $10 million fully guaranteed.</h5>
					<p>Emmanuel Sanders - NO - 2 years, $16 million, $10 million fully guaranteed.</p>
					<p>Why the optimism you ask? Because simply the defense can't focus on stopping everyone. At age 33, I understand the hesitation, but Sanders has shown he's still able to produce despite sub-par quarterbacks after this past season. With future Hall of Famer Drew Brees throwing to a defense focused on stopping Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara, there's now an opportunity available for a second wide receiver to earn consistent targets. With the departure of Ted Ginn Jr. and no receivers drafted, it's safe to assume that Sanders will be given every opportunity to win that role and become a sneaky play.</p>
