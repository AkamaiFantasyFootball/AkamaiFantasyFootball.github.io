					<p>As I make my projections, there are always unique discrepancies between the consensus rankings and my own. Sometimes, they can be negligible, and others are vast. This year, I found four players whom I have a larger discrepancy on where they should be ranked (6Pt Passing TD). Two will be players I have ranked higher than consensus and two will be lower. </p>
					
					<h5>Underrated</h5>

					<h5>Dak Prescott - DAL (10)</h5>
					<p>Coming off a top-three season in 2023, I was very high on him last year, but I was disappointed with inconsistent games and injuries that ended Prescott's season early. When healthy (played 16 games in two of the last four seasons), he threw over 4,400 yards and 35 touchdowns. While he's not a prolific rushing threat, he's mobile enough to be a redzone threat (three rushing touchdowns over the last two seasons). With that upside and the addition of George Pickens, he's a top ten QB drafted after names like Brock Purdy and Justin Herbert, who don't have the same upside on their offenses. The DAL offense signed Javonte Williams and drafted Jayden Blue, but it should still be a pass-heavy offense that will rely on Prescott's arm. He is 32, and the inconsistent games last season may continue, but he's undervalued if he falls to the double-digit rounds. </p>

					
					<h5>Jared Goff - DET (8)</h5>
					<p>Over the last three seasons, Goff has thrown for at least 4,400 yards and 29 touchdowns each season, with a career high of 37 touchdowns last season. He lacks the rushing ability to compete against someone like Kyler Murray or Bo Nix, but that doesn't mean he's a clear downgrade from them. Both players are rushing threats, which helps offset their lack of passing volume. However, Murray isn't a consistent QB1 in fantasy, and Nix was impressive, but one good season doesn't predict another. If you think their upsides are higher than Goff's floor, that's reasonable, but week-to-week consistency is beneficial. If Goff continues to throw around 35 touchdowns, he will outperform his ADP outside of the top ten and is one of my favorite targets if I end up waiting to draft a QB to focus on other positions. </p>
				
					<h5>Overrated</h5>


					<h5>Justin Herbert - LAC (12)</h5>
					<p>Over the last two seasons with coach Jim Harbaugh, Herbert has yet to throw for 4,000 yards and 24 touchdowns. He's a mobile threat that can make plays with his legs (five rushing touchdowns in the last two seasons). Still, the offense will lean towards a run-heavy approach, drafting RB Omarion Hampton in the first round and signing Najee Harris to create a 1-2 punch that will be a focal point in the offense. They also signed Keenan Allen and drafted WR Tre Harris in the second round, so the offense will likely continue to improve, but if you're expecting a top 12 season, then you will be disappointed if he doesn't reach 25-26 touchdowns. The injury to OT Rashawn Slater is a concern, and I view Herbert as a streaming option instead of a week-to-week starter.</p>

					<h5>Jayden Daniels- WAS (12)</h5>
					<p>I like Jayden Daniels. The reason I have him here is that I have seen him go as high as the 3rd QB behind Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson. I understand that the team traded for T Laremy Tunsil and signed WR Deebo Samuel to help the offense take the next step, but guys like Jalen Hurts and Joe Burrow have proven their top-five status over multiple seasons. Daniels's rushing ability (891 rush yards and six touchdowns) is what helped propel him into top five status last season, and if he takes a small step back, he could fall to QB6/7 and still have a great season. If you believe Daniels has the highest upside, I cannot argue against that, but unless you're in a superflex league, I doubt the difference between him and Hurts/Burrow will be worth drafting him in the third round.  </p>
